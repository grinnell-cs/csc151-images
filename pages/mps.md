# Mini Projects

Mini-projects provide an opportunity to apply what you have learned
in labs and readings to more complex problems.  They are "mini projects"
in the sense that you could potentially expand them into larger projects
that you might share with others.  (We'd encourage you to consider doing
so, particularly if you anticipate going on in CS and can find the time
to do so.)
