You'd think the [syllabus](../syllabus) and [schedule](../schedule) would provide all the info you need for a course, wouldn't you?  But we've found over the years that it can be helpful to provide additional information.  To ensure that you read the information, some CS faculty may even give you [an assignment](../assignments/survey).  What else is there?  Let's see.

  : A bit of philosophy (more or less).

[Grading](grading)

## Other versions of the course

These also aren't strictly handouts, but we didn't have a better place for them.  The list is incomplete.
