You'd think the [syllabus](../syllabus) and [schedule](../schedule)
would provide all the info you need for a course, wouldn't you?  But
I've found over the years that it can be helpful to provide additional
information.  To ensure that you read the information, I even give you
[an assignment](../assignments/survey).  What else is there?  Let's see.

## Teaching, grading, and such

[On teaching and learning](teaching)
  : A bit of philosophy (more or less).

[Grading](grading)
  : More details on grading processes (and a bit on the underlying philosophy).

[Gradescope](gradescope)
  : A few notes on the grading platform we're using.

## Other important issues

[Accommodations and adjustments](accommodations)
  : Policies and practices (and why I use two terms)

[Accessibility of Web pages](accessibility)
  : Why I try to keep pages accessible and who to report to when they're not.

[Academic integrity](academic-integrity)

[Pre-Assessments and Post-Assessments](prepost)

## Secondary topics

[Some thoughts on electronic mail](email)
  : This page provides some details about how to best use electronic mail when dealing with me.

[An old FAQ](faq)
  : I'm not sure when this is from.  I've kept it around for some reason.  I made a few changes for this term, but not enough.  I may make more.

## Some Scheme Stuff

[Terminology](terminology)
  : Some important terminology.

[The Zen of Booleans](zen-of-booleans)

## Other versions of the course

The list is incomplete.
