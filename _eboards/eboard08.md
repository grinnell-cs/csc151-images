Questions
---------

### Administrative

### MP2

How do I add a description to an image?

> Almost all of the basic image-creation procedures (including
  `solid-polygon` and `image-subtract`) have an optional parameter for
  a description of the image. You should generate that description.

> For example, here are two versions of `solid-isosceles-triangle`.

> ```
(define sit-a
  (lambda (width height color)
    (solid-polygon (list (pt (/ width 2) 0)
                         (pt width height)
                         (pt 0 height))
                   color)))
```

> ```
(define sit-b
  (lambda (width height color)
    (solid-polygon (list (pt (/ width 2) 0)
                         (pt width height)
                         (pt 0 height))
                   color
                   (string-append "a "
                                  (number->string width)
                                  "-by-"
                                  (number->string height)
                                  " "
                                  (describe-color color)
                                  " isosceles triangle"))))
```

### Reading (Colors)

I wasn't sure how to remove the blue component of a color.

> ```
(define remove-blue
  (lambda (color)
    (rgb (rgb-red color) (rgb-green color) 0)))
```

Why and when do you use "color-name->rgb" function?

> When we're working with names (e.g., "blue") and want to do more
  computational things (like making them darker).

Can you please explain this part 

```
;;; (color-merge-red-green c) -> color?
;;;   c : color?
;;; Make both the red and green components closer to the average of the
;;; two components.
(define color-merge-red-green
  (lambda (c)
    (rgb (quotient (+ (color-red c) (color-red c) (color-green c)) 3)
         (quotient (+ (color-red c) (color-green c) (color-green c)) 3)
         (color-blue c))))
```
