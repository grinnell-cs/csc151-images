Questions
---------

### Administrative

Will you ever tell us our tokens?

> Probably not. You can assume you have enough.

Can I bring a sheet of hand-written notes for each quiz?

> Yes. But you can only refer to one set of notes for each quiz.

Can I type my quiz notes on the computer?

> No.

Can I photocopy a page of the magic notebook?

> No. That destroys the magic.
