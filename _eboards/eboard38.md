### Sample in-class binary-search question

Given the following vector and call to `binary-search`, report on
the values of `lb`, `ub`, and `midpoint` at every recursive call
until the value is found or not found.

### Sample SoLA binary-search question

As you've observed, when there are multiple elements with the same
key, `binary-search` returns the first one it finds. Rewrite
`binary-search` so that it returns the first of the set of matching
elements. You must still use a divide-and-conquer approach; you 
may not simply step backwards one-by-one through the vector.
