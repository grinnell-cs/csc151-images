What if I've overspent tokens and I haven't read the class syllabus?

> Nothing.

When will you post the MP grades?

A class activity, part 1
------------------------

Grab white cards.  Write things down.  Whee!

"The subject matter of this class"
----------------------------------

* A story
* The broad subject matter of the class
    * This is a course intended to help you learn computational thinking,
      develop problem-solving skills, and introduce you to the functional
      model of computation/programming.
* Another perspective
    * The 24 LAs
* Other things that aren't evaluated, but may still be important
    * You have awesome classmates
    * You should support them (and it's valuable to do so) [+1]
    * Skills at working with those awesome people
        * Communication
        * Pair programming
        * Collaboration
    * There is more to life than CS
    * Sequencing
    * It's okay to ask for help; you don't have to do everything on your own.
    * When you have an insane amount of work, you learn how to manage it. [+1]
    * And that it's good to step away from it.
    * There's value to things beyond this class
    * Being mindful of your own thinking and approaches.
    * Snark is love.

EOCEs
-----

* I will not be in class for EOCEs.
* Neither will the mentors.

The other section had a much larger and much longer final project,
including many more classes devoted to team work on the project.
In exchange, they didn't have the kinds of days in which the course
debriefs on a topic or plans for an assignment or I spend too long
answering a question or ....

* I'd prefer a much longer project and would give up those days.
                        [ 3]
