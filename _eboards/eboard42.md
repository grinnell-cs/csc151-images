### Administrative

Do we have pre-reflections and post-reflections for SoLA 5?

> No.

When will we get SoLA 4 back?

> Sunday, I hope.

When will we get MP 9 back?

### Redos

A class activity, part 1
------------------------

Grab white cards.  Write things down.  Whee!

"The subject matter of this class"
----------------------------------

* A story
* Scheme programming, Computational Thinking, Functional Problem Solving,
  How to build software (testing), General skills, ...
* The broad subject matter of the class
    * This is a course intended to help you learn computational thinking,
      develop problem-solving skills, and introduce you to the functional
      model of computation/programming.
* Another perspective
    * The 24 LAs
* Other things that aren't evaluated, but may still be important. (_TPS_)
    * "My classmates are awesome; I should support them in their activities."
    * UM : Use Math [+1]
    * If you perservere (sp), you can succeed. And you have support in
      persevering.
    * How to collaborate in a group (and a pair). It was a good skill
      to work on.
    * Assigned work actually helps you learn.
    * It's okay to say "I'm not sure" when someone asks you a question.
    * It's okay to tell your professor that they failed to teach you anything.
    * Blame your partner.
    * Try hard early on even though you have other chances.
    * It's more important *that* you learn something than *when* you learn it.
    * Thinking on your feet (or behind) is an important skill.
    * Care about each other.
    * Moderation in all ou do.
    * Consent is essential, but insufficient.
