_TPS_

What is a vector?

* A mechanism for storing sequential data (something like a list).

What are the key vector procedures?

* `(vector-set! vec index new-value)` - Go to the index in the vector
  and put in `new-value`. There is no corresponding list procedure (at
  least not one we've seen).
* `(make-vector n val)` - Makes a vector with the given number of copies
  of `val`.
  A lot like `(make-list n val)` - Makes a list with the given number
  of copies of `val.
* `(vector-length vec)` - Tells you how many values are in the vector.
  A lot like `(length lst)`.
* `(vector-ref vec index)` - extract the value at the given index.
  `(list-ref lst index)` - extract the value at the given index.
    * `vector-ref` is generally *much* faster because lists require
      us to call `cdr` a lot of times.
* `(vector val0 val1 ...)` - Makes a vector of values.
  `(list val0 val1 ...)` - Makes a list of values.

What are the three C list procedures?

* `(cons val lst)` - Builds a new list by adding `val` to the front of `lst`.
  No equivalent for vectors.
* `(car lst)` - Grabs the first value in `lst`. We can use 
   `(vector-ref vec 0)` to get the equivalent behavior for vectors.
* `(cdr lst)` - Returns a new list that contains all but the first value
  of `lst`.
  No equivalent for vectors.

What distinguishes vectors from lists?

* Vectors are mutable; you can change the elements inside. We can't
  change the elements in lists. (We just build new, similar lists.)
* Accessing elements in lists is slow (unless we want to access them
  from front to back). Accessing elements in vectors is fast.
* You can make lists shorter and longer; you can't generally make
  vectors shorter and longer.

Why would you use one rather than the other?

* We use vectors when we want to change the elements of our collection.
* We use vectors when we may need to "randomly" access the elements of
  our collection.
* We use lists when we may want to change the length of our collection
  (e.g., remove elements).

How does `vector-set!` differ from other procedures we've seen?

* `vector-set!` is the first procedure we've encountered that changes
  its input. This will affect how we approach programming.
* It has an exclamation point! (Also known as a "bang" because
  programmers are somewhat lazy.)
* It doesn't return anything.
    * It's easy to lose things if you don't name them first.

```
> (vector-set! (make-vector 5 11) 0 2)
> (define stuff (make-vector 5 11))
> stuff
'#(11 11 11 11 11)
> (vector-set! stuff 0 2)
> stuff
'#(2 11 11 11 11)
```

Detour:

* You may have noted that Scheme lists and Scheme expression look
  nearly the same. You can evaluate and Scheme list as if it were
  a Scheme expression.

How might programming with vectors differ from the other kinds of
programming we've done? (Think especially about recursive programming
and/or the effects of `vector-set!`.)

* We're going to change how we sequence things.
* In the past, we'd write `(proc3 (proc2 (proc1 val)))`.
* That generally won't work if one of the procedures returns nothing.
* `(define vec3 (vector-set! (vector-set! (make-vector 2 0) 0 7) 1 11))`
  doesn't work.
* We will write things in sequence, rather than nesting.
```
(define vec3 (make-vector 2 0))
(vector-set! vec3 0 7)
(vector-set! vec3 1 11)
vec3
```

### Some exercises

```
;;; (vector-tally-odd vec) -> integer?
;;;   vec : (vector-of exact-integer?)
;;; Count how many odd numbers are in the vector.
(define vector-tally-odd
  (lambda (vec)
    (vector-tally-odd-helper vec 0)))

;;; (vector-tally-odd-helper vec index) -> integer?
;;;   vec : (vector-of exact-integer?)
;;;   index : exact-integer? (index in the vector)
;;; Count how many odd numbers are in the vector starting at the given
;;; index.
(define vector-tally-odd-helper
  (lambda (vec index)
    (if BASE-CASE
        BASE-VALUE
        (POST-PROCESS (vector-tally-odd-helper vec (CHANGE index))))))
```

* We'll need to use recursion, but we'll need to keep track of the
  current index in order to do so.
    * We'll need to create a helper procedure.
* We'll get to use `vector-ref` to count elements
* It will look a lot like the list recursive version

As dedicated recursive programmers, we know to ask four basic questions.

* What's the base case? When the index is the length of the vector.
* What's the base value? (If I start at index 5 in a length 5 vector, how
  many odd numbrs can I see between index 5 and the end of the vector?).
  0
* What's the recursive call?
* What do we do with the result of the recursive call?

```
;;; (vector-tally-odd vec) -> integer?
;;;   vec : (vector-of exact-integer?)
;;; Count how many odd numbers are in the vector.
(define vector-tally-odd
  (lambda (vec)
    (vector-tally-odd-helper vec 0)))

;;; (vector-tally-odd-helper vec index) -> integer?
;;;   vec : (vector-of exact-integer?)
;;;   index : exact-integer? (index in the vector)
;;; Count how many odd numbers are in the vector starting at the given
;;; index.
(define vector-tally-odd-helper
  (lambda (vec index)
    (if (>= index (vector-length vec))
        0
        (+ (if (odd? (vector-ref vec index))
             1
             0)
           (vector-tally-odd-helper vec (+ 1 index))))))
```

```
> (vector-tally-odd (vector))
0
> (vector-tally-odd (vector 2))
0
> (vector-tally-odd (vector 1))
1
> (vector-tally-odd (vector 1 -1 3 11 5 1))
6
> (vector-tally-odd (vector 2 1 2 -1 3 2 2 11 2 5 2 2 1))
6
> (vector-tally-odd (vector 2 1 2 -1 3 2 2 0 0 11 2 5 2 2 1 -2))
6
```

```
;;; (vector-increment-odd! vec) -> void
;;;   vec : (vector-of exact-integer?)
;;; Add one to all the odd numbers in the vector.
```

### Q&A (from reading and elsewhere)

Can we go over how to make `tn3`?

> Sure.

Why is `tn1` immutable?

> Rules of Scheme: If you make a vector with the octothorpe, you get an immutable vector.

In our first self-check, `tn1`, `tn2`, and `tn3` all contain the same
elements. Why is `tn1` not equal to `tn2` or `tn3`?

> `tn1` is immutable. `tn2` and `tn3` are mutable. Immutable and mutable
  structures are not equal.

What is the 'file' type referred to in the reading? Are we talking about an actual .rkt file here?

> Whoops. Sometimes we cover how to build text and data files in the course. We didn't this semester.

I don't think I'm clear on what you mean by "DrRacket displaying the value of the vector" in Check 1. Does that just mean the result of calling `tn1`, `tn2`, etc?

> Yes, displaying the value in a vector is just what you get when you type the identifier.
