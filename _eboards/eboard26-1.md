Pairs and pair structures
-------------------------

_The mentors asked me to give you a quick summary._

Some basic principles.

* Any time you have a `cons`, draw a cons cell (pair).
    * Each box in the cons cell can hold ONE thing (a null or an arrow)
* Any time you have a list of length `n`, draw `n` cons cells in
  sequence, with a null at the end. Draw downward arrows to each value.
  in the list (except for nulls).
* For any explict nulls, draw a slash.

Example,

* `'((a b ()) c (d e) () ((f)))`

### Questions

Questions
---------

### Administrative

Will we have another chance after the final redo for a mini project?

> Nope. Original. First redo. Second redo. Ultimate redo.

Will we have a redo for MP9?

> Nope. It's all or nothing. But it has a very clear rubric which focuses
  primarily on "do this minimal stuff in this amount of time".

> It's also a (self-formed) group project.

### Mini-project 7

In mini-project 6, we needed to use local bindings to avoid identical
recursion, which makes things VERY slow. Do we have the same issue on
mini-project 7. If so, can you give an example?

> I don't believe so. We'll mostly use direct recursion here.

How should we implement `enhance-color`?

> For each position, find the neighboring pixels (including the pixel
  at that position), find their average, call `(enhance-color pixel average)`.

### Vectors

### Other

Vectors
-------

```
;;; (vector-increment-odd! vec) -> void
;;;   vec : (vector-of exact-integer?)
;;; Add one to all the odd numbers in the vector.
;;;
;;; E.g.,
;;;   > (define vec (vector 1 2 3 4 5))
;;;   > (vector-increment-odd! vec)
;;;   > vec
;;;   > #(2 2 4 4 6)
(define vector-increment-odd!
  (lambda (vec)
    (vector-increment-odd-helper! vec 0)))

;;; (vector-increment-odd-helper! vec index) -> void
;;;   vec : vector-of exact-integer?
;;;   index : exact-integer? (in the appropriate range)
;;; Add one to all the odd numbers in the vector starting at the
;;; the given index and going to the end.
(define vector-increment-odd-helper!
  (lambda (vec index)
    (cond
      [(>= index (vector-length vec))
       (void)]
      [else
       (when (odd? (vector-ref vec index))
          (vector-set! vec index (increment (vector-ref vec index))))
       (vector-increment-odd-helper! vec (+ index 1))])))
```

Note that we prefer not to explicitly write `void`, so we could also
use a `when` here.

```
(define vector-increment-odd-helper!
  (lambda (vec index)
    (when (< index (vector-length vec)) ; we're checking whether or not to continue
       (when (odd? (vector-ref vec index))
          (vector-set! vec index (increment (vector-ref vec index))))
       (vector-increment-odd-helper! vec (+ index 1))])))
```

Semantics of `when`

```
(when (TEST)
  consequent1
  ...
  consequentn)
```

* Evaluates the TEST. 
* If the TEST holds (evaluates to a truish value), we evaluate each of the
  consequents in turn and return the value of the last one.
* If the TEST fails (evaluates to false), we return NOTHING (`void`).
