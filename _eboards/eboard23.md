Administrivia
-------------

* Welcome back!  I hope you had wonderful breaks and that you are not broken.
* Yay!  Class 23 is on the 23rd.  I'm not sure whether or not that signifies
  anything special, but I'm still pleased.
* Quizzes returned.  Grade reports going out soon.
    * I'm amused that although only four people asked for a documentation
      quiz, about a dozen of you took it.
* Registration starts somewhat soon.  I hope that you consider going on to 
  CSC-161.
    * Check the priority registration page at <https://grinco.sharepoint.com/sites/Registrars_Office/SitePages/PriorityRegistration.aspx> for our latest registration processes.
* Question: Should I permit extra students in CSC-151?  
    * The normal cap is 24; we had 30; I'm considering 32.
    * More students means less individual attention, but more opportunities
      for students to take CSC-151.
    * Another way to think about it: _How were you negatively impacted by
      the size of this class?_
