Questions
---------

### Administrative

### MP5

### Recursion

How many ways are there to recurse? We know Lists and Numeric recursion, 
are there any others that we'll learn soon?

> There are many ways to recurse. We can recurse over any compound
  data type (e.g., strings).

> We'll learn vector recursion soon after break. However, you'll find
  that it's mostly an issue of numeric recursion.

> We'll learn tree recursion a few weeks later.
