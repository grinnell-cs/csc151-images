Administrative stuff
--------------------

### Introductory notes

* I've now had a conversation with a few people about being more efficient.
  The first step is something like "Ask for help when something
  doesn't work; move on to another problem if help is not immediately
  available."
    * Remember the Zone of Proximal Development
* When you ask me for help, it helps if you send me code (e.g., your whole
  Racket file). It may seem that way sometimes, but I'm not psychic.
* If you are leaving early for Spring Break, please drop me a note. Otherwise,
  I expect you to be in class on Friday.
* There's no lab today. We'll have a combination of lecture and discussion.

Questions
---------

_We're skipping recursion questions for now._

### Administrative

When can I make up the Documentation LA?

> On SoLA 2. (Or SoLAs 3, 4, 5)

Suppose I don't do well on the lists LA. When can I make that up?

> On SoLA 2. (Or SoLAs 3, 4, 5)

### MP5

I'm struggling with how to get part 2 to work. Any hints?

> You'll need to use some of the same ideas as in part 1. In particular,
  you'll find it helpful to write a helper procedure that checks whether
  its parameter is a shape or not and does different things based on
  that test.

### Scheme

### Other

Recursion basics
----------------

Recursion bears some similarity to decomposition.

* Decomposition: Take a bigger problem and break it up into smaller problems.
* Recursion: Take a big INPUT and make it smaller.
    * We assume that we've already solved the problem, but only for smaller
      input.
    * We write a solution that uses THE SAME PROCEDURE WE'RE ALREADY WRITING
      as a helper.
    * A magic recursion fairy makes the code work.
* We also identify a situation in which we can answer the problem directly
  (and then do so). We call this "the base case".

Examples!
---------

### To count the number of cards in a stack of cards

```
if the stack is empty
  return 0
otherwise
  remove one card
  ask your assistant to count the remaining cards
  add 1
```

This is the algorithm behind `length`.

### To count how many cards are odd

```
if the stack is empty
  return 0
otherwise
  remove one card
  ask your assistant to count the number of odd remaining cards
  if the card is odd
    add 1 to the number your assistant returned
  otherwise
    return the number your assistant returned
```

This is the algorithm behind: `tally`

### To get the cards that are odd

```
if the stack is empty
  return an empty stack
otherwise
  remove one card
  ask you assistant to grab the odd cards in the remaining stack
  if your card is odd
    add your card to the stack of odd cards you received and pass the
      updated stack along
  otherwise
    pass the odd cards along, skipping the even card.
```

This is the algorithm behind: `filter`

Converting to Scheme
--------------------

* How do I check if a list is empty?
* How do I add one to a number?
* How do I add an element to a list?
* How do I remove an element from a list?
* How do I check if the first element of a list is odd?

```
(define my-length
  (lambda (lst)
    (if (null? lst)
        0
        (+ 1 (my-length (cdr lst))))))
```

Yay! We wrote it correctly on the first try.

```
(define count-odd
  (lambda (lst)
    (if (null? lst)
        0
        (if (odd? (car lst))
            (+ 1 (count-odd (cdr lst)))
            (+ 0 (count-odd (cdr lst)))))))
```

Yay! We wrote it correctly on the first try.

Except ... it can be improved.

```
(define count-odd
  (lambda (lst)
    (if (null? lst)
        0
        (if (odd? (car lst))
            (+ 1 (count-odd (cdr lst)))
            (count-odd (cdr lst))))))
```

Or ...

```
(define count-odd
  (lambda (lst)
    (cond
      [(null? lst)
        0]
      [(odd? (car lst))
       (+ 1 (count-odd (cdr lst)))]
      [else
       (count-odd (cdr lst))])))
```

```
(define select-odd
  (lambda (lst)
    (cond
      [(null? lst)
       null]
      [(odd? (car lst))
       (cons (car lst) (select-odd (cdr lst)))]
      [else 
       (select-odd (cdr lst))])))
```

With a fix to the base case (which needs to be the empty list rather than 0), 
we got this right, too.
