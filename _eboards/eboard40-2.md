A class activity, part 1
------------------------

Grab white cards.  Write things down.  Whee!

"The subject matter of this class"
----------------------------------

* "_Fill in the blank_ helped me learn **the subject matter of this class.**"
* Scheme programming, Computational Thinking, Functional Problem Solving,
  How to build software (testing), General skills, ...
* The broad subject matter of the class
    * This is a course intended to help you learn computational thinking,
      develop problem-solving skills, and introduce you to the functional
      model of computation/programming.
* Another perspective
    * The 24 LAs
* Other things that aren't evaluated, but may still be important. (_TPS_)
    * Be kind.
    * Be snarky. Snark is love. (Maybe "snark is life", for Ted Lasso fans.)
    * ...

EOCEs
-----

* The mentor and I will leave during this portion of the class. Someone
  will need to grab us after you are finished.
* **Do not leave after EOCEs.**
