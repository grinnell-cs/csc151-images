Data abstraction
----------------

### Overview: What are key ideas in the reading?

* You can represent the same data in different ways (hash tables, vectors,
  lists, strings, ...).
* We should write procedures that are somewhat independent of the
  representation (as much as possible).
* However, we'll need to agree upon (or design) a basic set of procedures
  that correspond to what we want to do with data?
    * Create a name.
    * Extract title, given, family, suffix.
* We have to be careful about the assumptions we make. For example,
  not everyone has a family name.  Try to be inclusive.
    * You don't know.
* Unfortunate: We sometimes have to make compromises, those may be biasing
  against some people. At minimum, we should acknowledge that.

### Questions

How do we balance "not everyone has a last name" with "some people are too
lazy to enter their last name"?

> Names aren't great identifiers. They are repeated.

> We can set up systems that discourage people from leaving out data.

### Self-check 1: Printing names (â€¡)

Write a procedure, `(name->string name)`, that takes a name
and converts it to the appropriate string.  `name->string` should
work no matter what representation we use, even if we use a 
representation we have not yet covered.

```racket
> (name->string qe2)
"Queen Elizabeth II"
> (name->string clay) 
"Roy Clay Sr"
```

A solution and a thought process.

```
;;; (name->string name) -> string?
;;;   name : name?
;;; Convert a name to a string, no matter how names are implemented.
(define name->string
  (lambda (name)
    ...))
```

I have 
* `name-title` (which returns string or #f), 
* `name-given` (always returns a string), 
* `name-middle` (which returns a string or #f), 
* `name-family` (which returns a string or #f), and 
* `name-suffix` (which returns a string or #f)

```
(define name->string
  (lambda (name)
    (string-append
     (if (name-title name)
         (string-append (name-title name) " ")
         "")
     (name-given name)
     (if (name-middle name)
         (string-append " " (name-middle name))
         "")
     (if (name-family name)
         (string-append " " (name-family name))
         "")
     (if (name-suffix name)
         (string-append " " (name-suffix name))
         ""))))
```

I should probably clean up the code a bit.

```
(define name->string
  (let ([helper (lambda (str-or-false) 
                  (if str-or-false 
                      (string-append " " str-or-false)
                      ""))])
    (lambda (name)
      (string-append
       (if (name-title name)
           (string-append (name-title name) " ")
           "")
       (name-given name)
       (helper (name-middle name))
       (helper (name-family name))
       (helper (name-suffix name))))))
```

One alternate. Make a list! Look up documentation.

```
(define name>string
  (lambda (name)
    (string-join (filter string?
                         (list (name-title name)
                               (name-given name)
                               (name-middle name)
                               (name-family name)
                               (name-suffix name)))
                 " ")))
```

### Self-check 2: Yet another representation (â€¡)

Suppose we were planning to represent names as strings with the
components separated by vertical bars.  For example,
`"|Barack|Hussein|Obama|II"` or `"Queen|Elizabeth|||II"`.  Sketch
how you would write procedures like `name-given` and `name-family`
that extract the various parts of the name.  You might, for example,
use `string-split`.

A solution and a thought process.

```
(define name-prefix
  (lambda (name)
    (list-ref (string-split name "|") 0)))

(define name-given
  (lambda (name)
    (list-ref (string-split name "|") 1)))
```

Questions
---------

### Administrative

Are we permitted to use a page of notes on quizzes?

> Of course.

### Dictionaries / Maps / Hash Tables

In `(hash-ref hash key "")`, what does the "" do?

> If you give `hash-ref` three parameters, the last one is the "default",
  which is returned if the key is not in the hash.

### Registration

What does the "Do not click THIS button" do?

> Attempts to register you for classes (it's normally the register button),
  but all classes are marked as full, so it tells you to join the waiting
  lists and therefore makes you sad because the "Join Waiting List" feature
  does not yet work.

What are your opinions regarding our vendor?

> Ellucian SelfService (or whatever Ellucian we are using) is not 
  necessarily designed for schools like Grinnell nor registration 
  processes like we try to use. Perhaps it is unsurprising that it
  does not work properly all the time.

> I am frustrated that it yet again is adding stress to students'
  lives.
