Administrative stuff
--------------------

### The loss of a student

_We'll start with a minute of silence._

Some thoughts.

* I don't have special expertise in loss, other than having experienced
  it multiple times. Nonetheless, I'd like to share some thoughts with you.
* It is human nature to want to know more about what happened. However,
  we don't have the right to know more. Asking can place a burden on
  those grieving or add to their grief.
* It's okay to feel sad, even if you didn't know him well. The loss of
  someone your own age can feel particularly painful. It may also bring
  up other losses in your life.
* It's also okay not to feel sad, even if everyone around you seems to
  be sad. We all react in our own way and in our own time.
* Please try to find the time to take care of yourselves. I know that's
  especially hard amidst the end-of-semester work. But try. I hope a 
  quieter week in 151 will help.
* Please pay attention to those around you and offer the support you can.
  A hug. A note that you're thinking of them. Time to listen. All of these
  can help.
* Please ask for help when you need it. You are all high achievers, and you
  may not be used to asking for help. But it may be necessary right now.
  You may also not know what help you need. Sometimes saying "I need help"
  can be enough; others can work with you on figuring out what's right.
* This may be a particularly important week to visit the therapy dogs.

Sharing

* I debated whether or not to set aside time for sharing, particularly
  since there aren't trained professionals in the room. But we can still
  support each other, so I've set aside a few minutes in case anyone
  wants to share. 
* If you'd rather not be here for that, pleases step into the hallway.
  We'll bring you back in when sharing is over.

### Introductory notes

* MP 9 will be in week 13.
* SoLA 4 will be in week 14.

### Monday PSA

* People care about you. Please take care of yourselves.

Questions
---------

### Administrative

### Mini-project 7

### Dictionaries etc.

_Whoo! Almost no questions!_

How is a hash table different from a list of pairs?

> It provides more efficient access to elements (particularly when you 
  have a lot of elements).

> It lets us hide the underlying details. We think about the two or
  three key operations. 

> * Add an element `(hash-set! hash key value)`.
> * Look up an element `(hash-ref hash key)`.

We talked some about the look up time of a list vs a vector. Does
a hash have a look up time and method more similar to vectors or a
list?

> Mutable hash tables have lookup time similar to vectors.

Can you clarify what the common form means in terms of the new-hash 
procedures?

> When we want similar things to be treated the same, we must explicitly
  convert them to a form in which they are extactly the same if we want
  to use hash tables.

> Basically, ignoring case and non-letters (if I recall correctly).
