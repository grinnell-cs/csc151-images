Administrative stuff
--------------------

### Introductory notes

* I have not yet had time to get the quizzes graded. They should be graded
  and available on Gradescope by Saturday night. I'll bring the hardcopies 
  on Monday.
* I overslept this morning, so some links are missing from the eboard. I'll
  add them at the start of lab.
* If you sent me a recent email or TM asking for an extension, I may have 
  missed it. Please Teams Message me again.

### Introductory comments

_TPS_

What is a vector?

> A way to create/display/collect a set of values.

> It has new ways to work with the set when compared to lists as well
  as some similarities.

> We have `(vector-set! vec index new-value)`, which changes one value in 
  the vector. This seems to be different than what we have for lists.

> We have `(make-vector length val)`, which makes a vector of the given length
  containing that many copies of the value. (This is much like `make-list`.)

> We have `(vector v0 v1 v2 ...)`, which creates a vector. This is much
  like `list`.

> We have `(vector-length vec)`, which returns the number of elements in
  the vector. Similar to `length`.

> We have `(vector-ref vec index)`, which extracts the value at the given
  index. Similar to `list-ref`.

> We also have an equivalent to the tick mark, `'#(v0 v1 ...)`.

What distinguishes vectors from lists?

> We have `vector-set!` which mutates (changes) the vector. We do NOT have
  a way to change lists.

> `vector-ref` is supposedly fast, while `list-ref` requires us to `cdr`
  through the whole list. (And is somtimes slow.)

> We don't seem to have an `append` for vectors.

> The three C's of lists are `car`, `cdr` (not for vectors), `cons` (not
  for vectors). You can easily change the length of a list (or, more 
  precisely, build a new list of a different length); you cannot easily
  change the length of a vector.

Why would you use one rather than the other?

> If our work involves adding and removing elements, lists are probably 
  better.

> If our work involves changing elements or "random access" to elements,
  vectors are probably better.

How does `vector-set!` differ from other procedures we've seen?

> It doesn't return anything. We're used to using procedures that return
  things.

> We can't do something like 
  `(vector-set! (vector-set! (make-vector 2) 0 7) 1 11)`

> It becomes much more important to name things.

How might programming with vectors differ from the other kinds of
programming we've done? (Think especially about recursive programming
and maybe `vector-set!`.)

> In the past we nested for sequencing. `(proc3 (proc2 (proc1 ...)))`

> Now, we have to sequence in a different way.

> ```
(proc1! ...)
(proc2! ...)
(proc3! ...)
```

> That is, we don't generally nest `!` procedures.

### Some exercises

Both of these will require a recursive helper that keeps track of the index.

```
;;; (vector-tally-odd vec) -> integer?
;;;   vec : (vector-of exact-integer?)
;;; Count how many odd numbers are in the vector.
```

Things to think about

* We're going to have to keep track of where in the vector we are.
* That suggests a helper procedure.
* We'll be recursing over the position, starting at 0. Think about a
  base case, a base case value, a recursive call, and what to do with
  the recursive call.
    * base-case. Let's consider `(vector 5 8 9 2 3 3 7)`.
      Observation: We're done either when we're at length-1 (that's the
      last element) or length (that's beyond the last element). I'll
      go with length.
    * base-case-value: 0
    * recursive-call `(vector-tally-odd-helper vec (+ index 1))`.
    * what to do with the recursive call: If the current thing is odd,
      add 0, otherwise, add 1.

```
(define vector-tally-odd
  (lambda (vec)
    (vector-tally-odd-helper vec 0)))

;;; (vector-tally-odd-helper vec index) -> integer?
;;;   vec : vector-of? exact-integer?
;;; Count how many odd values are in the vector starting at position `index`.
(define vector-tally-odd-helper
  (lambda (vec index)
    (if (>= index (vector-length vec))
        0
        (+ (if (odd? (vector-ref vec index))
               1
               0)
           (vector-tally-odd-helper vec (+ index 1))))))

(define vector-tally-odd-helper
  (lambda (vec index)
    (cond
      [(>= index (vector-length vec))
       0]
      [(odd? (vector-ref vec index))
       (+ 1 (vector-tally-odd-helper vec (+ index 1)))]
      [else
       (vector-tally-odd-helper vec (+ index 1))])))
```

```
> (vector-tally-odd (vector))
0
> (vector-tally-odd (vector 0))
0
> (vector-tally-odd (vector 1))
1
> (vector-tally-odd (vector 1 2 3 4 5 6))
3
> (vector-tally-odd (vector 4 1 2 3 4 5 6 6 8 2 4))
3
> (vector-tally-odd (vector 4 1 2 3 4 5 6 6 8 2 4 5))
4
> (vector-tally-odd (vector 4 1 2 3 4 5 6 6 8 2 4 5 7))
5
```

```
;;; (vector-increment-odd! vec) -> void
;;;   vec : (vector-of exact-integer?)
;;; Add one to all the odd numbers in the vector.
;;;
;;; E.g.,
;;;   > (define vec (vector 1 2 3 4 5))
;;;   > (vector-increment-odd! vec)
;;;   > vec
;;;   > #(2 2 4 4 6)
(define vector-increment-odd!
  (lambda (vec)
    (vector-increment-odd-helper! vec 0)))

;;; (vector-increment-odd-helper! vec index) -> void
;;;   vec : vector-of exact-integer?
;;;   index : exact-integer? (in the appropriate range)
;;; Add one to all the odd numbers in the vector starting at the
;;; the given index and going to the end.
```

* Thought processes
* Recursion
    * base-case-test: When the index is greater than the length.
    * base-case-action: Return nothing.
    * recursive-case: `(vector-increment-odd-helper! vec (+ pos 1))`.
    * pre or post-process of recursive case. Check if the current
      value is odd or even and, if it's odd, add 1 to that value. 
      Otherwise, add 0 to that value.
* Also:
    * How do we deal with the "add one to odd numbers"?
    * (increment (vector-ref vec index))

```
(define vector-increment-odd-helper!
  (lambda (vec index)
    (cond
      [(>= index (vector-length vec))
       (void)]
      [else
       (when (odd? (vector-ref vec index))
          (vector-set! vec index (increment (vector-ref vec index))))
       (vector-increment-odd-helper! vec (+ index 1))])))
```

```
> (define vec (vector 1 2 3 4 5))
> vec
'#(1 2 3 4 5)
> (vector-increment-odd! vec)
> vec
'#(2 2 4 4 6)
```

### Q&A (from reading and elsewhere)

Can we go over how to make `tn3`?

> Sure.

> ```
(define tn3 (make-vector 2))
(vector-set! tn3 0 7)
(vector-set! tn3 1 11)
```

> ```
(define tn3 (make-vector 2 7))
(vector-set! tn3 1 11)
```

Why is `tn1` immutable?

> `(define tn1 #(7 11))`

> Rules of Scheme: If you make a vector with the octothorpe, you get an 
  immutable vector.

In our first self-check, `tn1`, `tn2`, and `tn3` all contain the same
elements. Why is `tn1` not equal to `tn2` or `tn3`?

> `tn1` is immutable. `tn2` and `tn3` are mutable. Immutable and mutable
  structures are not equal.

What is the 'file' type referred to in the reading? Are we talking about an actual .rkt file here?

> Whoops. Sometimes we cover how to build text and data files in the course. We didn't this semester.

I don't think I'm clear on what you mean by "DrRacket displaying the value of the vector" in Check 1. Does that just mean the result of calling `tn1`, `tn2`, etc?

> Yes, displaying the value in a vector is just what you get when you type the identifier.

Lab
---

Note: We'll do a second vector lab on Monday.

Note: This uses randomness, which we don't officially learn until next
week. For now, assume that `random` means `unpredictable`.
