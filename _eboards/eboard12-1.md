Q&A
---

### Administrative

### Booleans and conditionals

Why does the equality predicate `=` not also count as a comparator?

> Comparators are supposed to tell you whether one thing comes before another. `=` does not.

Could you go over the `not` procedure and its uses?

> Sure.

I read and reread the truish breakdown and was still confused. What
are examples of statements that would result in a truish output?
What would produce not false, but then not be true?

> `(not #f)` is always true, `#t`.

> However, there are values that are neither `#f` nor `#t`. For example,
  `"hello"` or the result of `(+ 2 3)`. We consider those "truish". If
  we use them as the test/guard in a conditional, instead of an error,
  we'll see them treated as if they were true.

What do we need to understand when making the distinction between
keywords and procedures?

> You should understand that the order of evaluation is different
  (and, preferably, what that order is).

> Normal (e.g., `(+ exp1 exp2 exp3)`):

> Lambda (i.e., `(lambda (params) exp)`):

> If (i.e., `(if test consequent alternate)`):

> And (i.e., `(and exp1 exp2 exp3)`):

> Or (ie.., `(or exp1 exp2 exp3)`):
