### Introductory notes

* In the interests of giving you as much time as possible to work with
  partner, I'm going to skip most of my normal "start of class" material.
  Please skim when you have time.
    * Please consider The AI talk on Thursday and the Jean Salac on Monday.
* I _think_ I'm up to date on grading token credits. Our three leaders
  have earned 24, 22, and 20 tokens.
* It's the time of the semester for lasts.
    * Today is our last quiz.
    * Tomorrow is our last reading response.
    * Friday is our last lab.
    * Friday is the last Middle of Everywhere.
    * Sunday our last mini-project is due.
    * Sunday our last pre-reflection is due.
* Our graders may have gotten confused by the change in policies for
  MP7. If your grade seems wrong, let me know. If I don't respond in
  a day, let me know again.
* I brought you food for your work day.
    * There's a Keurig in the CS commons.
    * Obligatory joke about Sam bringing food.
