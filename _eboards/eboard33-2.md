About the project
-----------------

Philosophical underpining

* We can use our computing skills to understand the world.
* We can use our ability to write programs that make/manipulate images to
  better understand artworks. 
* By making computer-based "sketches" of variants of an artwork, we can
  better understand the artist's intent / decisions.

Details

* You are going to write programs that create variants of a work of art.
* By making variants, you will (hopefully) understand design decisions
  better.
* We'll be using the artwork of Hilma af Klint.

Expectations

* Write `(image-series n width height)`, makes `n`th image in a series of
  variants of whatever image you selected.
    * `n` is an exact integer between 0 (inclusive) and 1000 (exclusive)
* With at least two recursive procedures.
* Using at least two image-making and image-manipulation techniques.
* Write about what you've done and what you've learned.
* Limit your time.
    * No fewer than five hours (including in-class time) per person.
    * No more than ten hours per person.
    * The time making the presentation counts.
    * The time writing about your code counts.
* Working in a group (between one and four people).
* Five-minute presentation in front of the class (and visitors) in week 
  14 (Wednesday).
* The post-reflection is REQUIRED.

Questions and Clarifications
----------------------------
