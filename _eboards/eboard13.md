### Friday PSA

About SoLAs
-----------

"Set of Learning Assessments"

* Somewhat like "a bunch of quizzes wrapped together".

Similarities

* Each problem is intended to take no more than fifteen minutes.
* If you've completed an LA already (e.g., conditionals), there's
  no need to do it on the SoLA.  (And I'd prefer that you don't.)
* Difficulty should be similar.
* You can rely on notes but not other people.

Differences

* SoLAs are online, take-home, and you have DrRacket available.
* You may also use the course web site and the DrRacket documentation.
  (Please do not use other online resources.)
* I generally expect working code.
* Each problem has a sixty-minute timer (or a ninety-minute timer, if
  you have a time-and-a-half accommodation).  The long timer is intended 
  to help avoid anxiety.  If you find yourself spending more than fifteen
  minutes on a problem, stop and plan to do it the next time.
* SoLAs are taken outside of class.  They are released immediately
  after class on Wednesday and due at 10:30 on Thursday.
* You need advance permission for an extension on a SoLA.
* I ask you to attest to your academic integrity.
