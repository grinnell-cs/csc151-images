About SoLAs
-----------

"Set of Learning Assessments"

* Somewhat like "a bunch of quizzes wrapped together".

Similarities

* Each problem is intended to take no more than fifteen minutes.
* If you've completed an LA already (e.g., conditionals), there's
  no need to do it on the SoLA.  (And I'd prefer that you don't.)
* Difficulty should be similar.
* You can rely on notes but not other people.
* If you get an LA wrong on a SoLA, you can try it again on the
  next SoLA (or the next or ...)

Differences

* SoLAs are online, take-home, and you have DrRacket available.
* You may also use the course web site and the DrRacket documentation.
  (Please do not use other online resources.)
* I generally expect working code.
* Each problem has a sixty-minute timer (or a ninety-minute timer, if
  you have a time-and-a-half accommodation).  The long timer is intended 
  to help avoid anxiety.  If you find yourself spending more than fifteen
  minutes on a problem, stop and plan to do it the next time.
* SoLAs are taken outside of class.  They are released immediately
  after class on Wednesday and due at 10:30 on Thursday.
* You need advance permission for an extension on a SoLA.
* I ask you to attest to your academic integrity.

### Questions

Once I've received an "S" on an LA topic, do I have to do any more
LAs on that topic?
 
> No, please don't.

How does this work with the count of LAs?

> Just think of it as more LAs that you happen to be taking at the same
  time.

How do I prepare?

> Go to mentor session!

> Do practice problems.

> Write your own questions.

> Flashcards (and good notes).

> Do the pre-assessment.

Questions
---------

_Ask questions.  It's part of self gov.  If you have questions, others
likely do, too._

### On Gradescope

What should I do if my code doesn't run?

> DrRacket occasionally saves files in a custom format.  Unfortunately,
  that format doesn't on gradescope.  So we need to make sure that you
  save the code as a text file.

Why can't you put diamonds in nested expressions in `cut`?

> Because the designer was too lazy to implement that.

> If I don't implement that, you have to think harder about how to use
  cut and compose together.

> For example, `(cut (+ (* 3 <>) 5))`, is the same as.
  `(o (cut (+ <> 5)) (cut (* 3 <>)))`

### On administrative stuff

Please tell me more about how the SoLA relates to the quizzes and my grade
in the class.

> I want you to demonstrate mastery of the learning outcomes as part of
  the grade in the class.  We use learning assessments (LAs) to determine 
  whether or not you have satisfactorily (sp?) mastered each learning outcome.

> Each quiz is an LA.

> Each problem on a SoLA is an LA.
