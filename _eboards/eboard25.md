Administrivia
-------------

* Registration starts next Wednesday.  I hope that you consider going on to 
  CSC-161.
    * Check the priority registration page at <https://grinco.sharepoint.com/sites/Registrars_Office/SitePages/PriorityRegistration.aspx> for our latest registration processes.
    * Check out the the priority rules for each class at <https://grinco.sharepoint.com/:x:/s/Registrars_Office/EQfHJD0_kHlMgqJDvkATg18B8k6Sc5C_SOtUiQ51Ig2LZg?e=HQS7zq>.  CSC's were not yet up-to-date when I last checked.
* I lost one of my hearing aids yesterday.  I will hear you even less well than normal.  (The time looking for it also put me behind.)
* The mentors and I would like to remind you that you should write documentation *before* you write code.  Documentation helps you think through the problem.
* See our Teams channels for a survey on the time for future mentor sessions.
* I'm going to run today's class as a talk/TPS day.
