Notes on recent quizzes
-----------------------

Quiz 7 was taken directly from the list recursion lab. Remember to
review the labs as you study.

For quiz 8, many of you got partway there, but not all the way.
Your goal is *no* repeated code (or as little as possible). I was
a bit generous in grading because I know quizzes can be stressful
(and it was just before break).
