Introduction
------------

Why do we have this module in CSC-151?

* Computers and computing technology have an outsize impact on the world.
* Those who develop computing technology should understand their resposibilities
  as professionals.
    * Most don't.
* We should have a day (or at least a class period) thinking about the
  impacts of technology and our responsibilites
* Reminder: CS table discusses these issues on most Tuesdays.
* Reminder: TWO concentrations that consider these kinds of issues as
  part of their work: Science, Medicine, and Society (SMS) and Digital
  Studies.

Other notes

* Lots of different approaches in CS classes.
* Sam likes the ACM code of ethics.
* AI has created large numbers of challenges, particularly to understanding
  why things are happening and unexpected factors.

Ethics
------

<https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics>

_Let's read them aloud. We'll just go around the room._

* 1. GENERAL ETHICAL PRINCIPLES.
    * 1.1 Contribute to society and to human well-being, acknowledging that all people are stakeholders in computing.
    * 1.2 Avoid harm.
    * 1.3 Be honest and trustworthy.
    * 1.4 Be fair and take action not to discriminate.
    * 1.5 Respect the work required to produce new ideas, inventions, creative works, and computing artifacts.
    * 1.6 Respect privacy.
    * 1.7 Honor confidentiality.
* 2. PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES.
    * 2.1 Strive to achieve high quality in both the processes and products of professional work.

Initial reflections
-------------------

_A think-pair-share activity._

### Which principles did you find surprising (or most surprising)?  Why?

### Which are your "favorite" principles?  Why?

### Which principles do you expect to be hardest to follow?  Why?

A case study
------------

_Modified from <https://ethics.acm.org/code-of-ethics/using-the-code/case-dark-ux-patterns/>.  (Please don't look there for analysis.)_

The change request Stewart received was simple enough: replace the web site's rounded rectangle buttons with arrows and adjust the color palette to one that mixes red and green text. But when Stewart looked at the prototype, he found it confusing. The left arrow suggested that the web site would go back to a previous page or cancel some action; instead, this arrow replaced the button for accepting the company’s default product. The right arrow, on the other hand, upgraded the user to the more expensive category; it also silently added a protection warranty without asking for confirmation. Stewart suggested to his manager that this confusing design would probably trick users into more expensive options that they didn’t want. The response was that these were the changes requested by the client.

Shortly after the updates were released into their production system, Stewart’s team was invited to a celebration. As a result of these changes, revenues at their client had increased significantly over the previous quarter. At the celebration, Stewart overheard some of the client’s managers discussing the small increase for refunds by users who claimed that they didn’t want the protection plan, but there weren’t many. One manager noted several complaints from visually impaired users, who noted that the mixture of red and green text obscured important disclaimers about the product.

Another case study
------------------

_Modified from <https://ethics.acm.org/code-of-ethics/using-the-code/case-malware-disruption/>.  Please don't read the analysis._

Responsible Services advertised its web hosting services as “cheap, guaranteed uptime, no matter what.” While some of Responsible’s clients were independent web-based retailers, the majority were focused on malware and spam. Several botnets used Responsible’s reliability guarantees to protect their command-and-control servers from take-down attempts. Spam and other fraudulent services leveraged Responsible for continuous delivery. Corrupted advertisements often linked to code hosted on Responsible to exploit browser vulnerabilities to infect machines with ransomware.

Despite repeated requests from major ISPs and international organizations, Responsible refused to intervene with these services, citing their “no matter what” pledge to their customers. Furthermore, international pressure from other governments failed to induce national-level intervention, as Responsible was based in a country whose laws did not adequately proscribe such hosting activities.

Ultimately, Responsible was forcibly taken offline through a coordinated effort from multiple security vendors working with several government organizations. This effort consisted of a targeted worm that spread through Responsible’s network. This denial-of-service attack successfully took Responsible’s machines offline, destroying much of the data stored with the ISP in the process. All of Responsible’s clients were affected. No other ISPs reported any impact from the worm, as it included mechanisms to limit its spread. As a result of this action, spam and botnet traffic immediately dropped significantly. In addition, new infections of several forms of ransomware ceased.

_TPS: Was the response appropriate?  Ethical?  What principles would permit the security vendors and government organizations to write such software.  Which might suggest that they behaved unethically?_

Final thoughts
--------------

_We probably won't have time for any final thoughts._
