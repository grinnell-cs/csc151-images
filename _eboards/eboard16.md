Administrative stuff
--------------------

* It appears that I've been forgetting to publish grades on Gradescope.
  I'm working on getting that caught up.
* For pre-reflections and readings that I had not responded to in a
  timely fashion, I often just gave you credit.
* Please make sure that the autograder can run on your submissions!
    * For MP3, it was often because you referred to "kitten.jpg" but
      did not include it.
* The range of times reported for MP3 worries me (from 3 to 20). We hope
  that MPs will normally take you 4--5 hours. (Unfortunately, there's a
  range of how long people take. In the real world, successful professional
  programmers can have a factor of ten difference in productivity.)
    * Shoot for M as a starting point!
    * Ask questions early.

Some notes from your instructors
--------------------------------

Lots of techniques. It's okay that you're struggling to figure out which.

Important to think about what type of thing you want. (Is this asking for a
procedure, a string, a list?)

Questions
---------

### Friday's Lab

How should we write "add 5 to all"?

> `(map (cut (+ 5 <>)) lst)`
