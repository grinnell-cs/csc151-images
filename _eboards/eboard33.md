### Friday PSA

Questions
---------

### Administrative

Do we have to be in a group for Project 9?

> No.

### SoLA 8

### Tail recursion

Where does the term "kernel" come from? 

> My colleague, John Stone, seems to have coined it as part of a broader
  Iowan "husk and kernel" programming strategy. The husk protects the
  kernel. The kernel is where the real value happens.

Is there a situation where you could have multiple accumulator variables?

> Certainly. The split procedure that you worked on in the last lab
  is one such example.
