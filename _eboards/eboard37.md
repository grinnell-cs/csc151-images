Comments on mini-project 7
--------------------------

* I had expected people to use hash tables to build the frequency
  information.  (I'll make that much clearer next year.)
    * If you didn't use hash tables, you likely wrote a program that
      did not work very efficiently; repeatedly iterating a list is
      expensive/slow.
* Our graders are still working on grading MP7.  They hope to get
  it back soon.
