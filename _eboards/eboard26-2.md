Pairs and pair structures
-------------------------

_The mentors asked me to give you a quick summary._

Some basic principles.

* Any time you have a `cons`, draw a cons cell (pair).
    * Each box in the cons cell can hold ONE thing (a null or an arrow)
* Any time you have a list of length `n`, draw `n` cons cells in
  sequence, with a null at the end. Draw downward arrows to each value.
  in the list (except for nulls).
* For any explict nulls, draw a slash.

Example,

* `'((a b ()) c (d e) () ((f)))`

### Questions

How do we represent the empty list?

> A slash.

Do we draw an arrow to the `f`?

> Yes. We draw arrows to everything that's not null.

What is `((f))`?

> A single-element list containing a single-element list that contains `f`.

Are all lists made of pairs?

> No. The empty list is not made of pairs.

Will we have pair structures that aren't lists on the quiz?

> Probably. 

> `(a . b)` looks like one pair with an arrow to `a` from the left cell
  and an arrow to `b` from the right cell.

> Note that I will probably write that more explicitly as `(cons 'a 'b)`.

Questions
---------

### Administrative

Will we have another chance after the final redo for a mini project?

> Nope. Original. First redo. Second redo. Ultimate redo.

Will we have a redo for MP9?

> Nope. It's all or nothing. But it has a very clear rubric which focuses
  primarily on "do this minimal stuff in this amount of time".

> It's also a (self-formed) group project.

When will tokens be tallied?

> Before the end of the semester.

### Mini-project 7

In mini-project 6, we needed to use local bindings to avoid identical
recursion, which makes things VERY slow. Do we have the same issue on
mini-project 7. If so, can you give an example?

> I don't believe so. We'll mostly use direct recursion here.

How should we implement `enhance-color`?

> For each position, find the neighboring pixels (including the pixel
  at that position), find their average, call `(enhance-color pixel average)`.

How do we add variables within a procedure?

> Generally, using `let`. Put the `let` at the appropriate place.

> You can ask me.

### Vectors

### Other

Vectors
-------

```
;;; (vector-increment-odd! vec) -> void
;;;   vec : (vector-of exact-integer?)
;;; Add one to all the odd numbers in the vector.
;;;
;;; E.g.,
;;;   > (define vec (vector 1 2 3 4 5))
;;;   > (vector-increment-odd! vec)
;;;   > vec
;;;   > #(2 2 4 4 6)
(define vector-increment-odd!
  (lambda (vec)
    (vector-increment-odd-helper! vec 0)))
```

What do you remember about writing recursive procedures over vectorss?

* You could turn the vector into a list and do recursion. Sam emphatically
  discourages that.
* We probably need a helper to keep track of the index.
* (Our change will have to be to elements; we can't make it longer or shorter.)
* We sequence differently when using `vector-set!`. Instead of nesting, we
  write operations one after the other.

How should we write `vector-increment-odd-helper!`.

* Base case test: If index = length of vector (Sam prefers >= for safety)
* Base case value: Stop. Maybe return the vector. Return NOTHING (void)
* Recursive call: `(vector-increment-odd-helper! vec (+ 1 index))`
* Pre-processing/post-processing: We have to a vector-set (inside a
  conditional)
* Recursive case test (Alternate to base case test): When do we continue?
  `(< index length-of-vector)`.

```
;;; Increment all the odd values in the vector starting at the given index.
(define vector-increment-odd-helper!
  (lambda (vec index)
    (cond
      [(< index (vector-length vector))
       (vector-set! vec index (+ 1 (vector-ref vec index)))
       (vector-increment-odd-helper! vec (+ 1 index))])))
```

Finalized

```
(define vector-increment-odd-helper!
  (lambda (vec index)
    (cond
      [(< index (vector-length vec))
       (when (odd? (vector-ref vec index))
         (vector-set! vec index (+ 1 (vector-ref vec index))))
       (vector-increment-odd-helper! vec (+ 1 index))])))
```
