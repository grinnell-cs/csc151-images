Comments on Pre-Assessments
---------------------------

I looked at the first dozen or so pre-assessments.  I'd like to see
deeper brain dumps.  I also think it would help you.  (Evidence suggests
that brain dumps help in every class.)

* What procedures are relevant?
* What are common program structures (e.g., for list recursion or 
  numeric recursion)
* What procedures have you written?  What do they look like?

Let's practice: Brain dump on vectors.

Questions
---------

### Registration

### Vectors

### Administrative

### SoLA 2

How will we know if we should take the quizzes on vectors and diagramming 
structures on Friday?

> I will do my best to grade any of those that come in by 7pm on Thursday.

Lab

_Finally, we get to do a lab on vectors._
