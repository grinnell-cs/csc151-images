About SoLA 2
------------

* If you are missing LAs before a SoLA, you should really attempt them
  on the SoLA (if only to see what they look like).
* You have DrRacket available.  You should check your code.
* Many of you said that `(filter pred? lst)` returns a list of the
  values for which `pred?` returns true.  What if it returns neither
  true nor false?

Questions
---------

### SoLA 2

"The style LA killed a little bit of my soul."

> Now you know how our graders feel.

> I'll give a style quiz this Friday (sorry ???).

Can we go over _this LA_?

> You can chat attend the mentor session.  You can also ask the evening
  tutors.

### MP6

### Administrative

I had an extension on an MP and emailed you the MP.  How do I email you
the post-assessment?

> You can find the questions in the [handouts section](https://rebelsky.cs.grinnell.edu/Courses/CSC151/2023Fa/handouts/prepost).

Can I use tokens to turn in pre- and post-assessments late?

> That violates the point of pre- and post-assessments.  Particularly
  for pre-assessments, it's important for you to do them before the
  assignment.

What will Friday's quiz be on?

> Randomness.

> Makeup on diagramming data.

> Makeup on style.

My family is coming to visit and I may have to miss class on Nov 10 
and/or Nov 13.

> "There's more to life than computer science."

> Make up the work on your own.  Check the eboard and talk to peers.

> You do not get a different time to take the quiz.  You'll have to 
  make it up on a subsequent Friday (or SoLA).
