Administrative stuff
--------------------

### Introductory notes

* I've now had a conversation with a few people about being more efficient.
  The first step is something like "Ask for help when something
  doesn't work; move on to another problem if help is not immediately
  available."
    * Remember the Zone of Proximal Development
* When you ask me for help, it helps if you send me code (e.g., your whole
  Racket file). It may seem that way sometimes, but I'm not psychic.
* If you are leaving early for Spring Break, please drop me a note. Otherwise,
  I expect you to be in class on Friday.
* There's no lab today. We'll have a combination of lecture and discussion.

Questions
---------

_We're skipping recursion questions for now._

### Administrative

When can I make up the Documentation LA?

> On SoLA 2.

Suppose I don't do well on the lists LA. When can I make that up?

> On SoLA 2.

### MP5

I'm struggling with how to get part 2 to work. Any hints?

> You'll need to use some of the same ideas as in part 1. In particular,
  you'll find it helpful to write a helper procedure that checks whether
  its parameter is a shape or not and does different things based on
  that test.
