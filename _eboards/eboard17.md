Questions
---------

### Grade reports

### Administrative

### MP4

When do we use testing?

> You use testing on the problems that say "write a test".

How do I create different sets of images with the same procedure (stack)?

> Ideally, by giving it different sets of parameters.

How complicated does the freestyle need to be?

> For an M, not very complicated. You can use the extant procedures.

> For an E, you need to write more procedures like those from each
  section (i.e., another way to turn a shape into a list of shapes,
  then a list of shapes, then a list of lists of shapes; another way
  to turn each shape in each of those structures into a different shape;
  and another way to combine these shapes in alternating ways).

### Lists

Is there a simpler way to do `cadddddddddddr` if the list is super long? I suppose `list-ref` or something else could do the trick, so why is `cadr` important to have?

> `list-ref` is better if you're going fairly far into the list.

> There's also a limit on how many `a`'s and `d`'s you can have in the
  `c*r`.  I think it's about six in DrRacket.

> `cadr` is much shorter than `(list-ref lst 0)`. We can also use it
  in composition and `map` and such.

Can you go over `cddr` `caar` `cdar` and `cadr`?

> Sure!
