Final Computations
------------------

Readings:   (10 / 13)
Labs:       (10 / 11)
MPs:        (1 Es, 1 Ms, and 1 Rs)
LAs:        (5 / 8)

Metas:      8 / 9
Missed:     5 (3 reading, 1 lab, 1 meta)
```

"What grade am I getting?"

* If you have five or more LAs done, you're probably in good shape,
  as long as you're feeling more confident about at least two of them.
  (22/24 for an A).
* If you have at least one E you're doing fine on MPs. If you're mostly
  at Ms, you're also doing fine, but you should look for ways to get to
  Es. Ask questions. If you have a lot of I's (or missings), we should
  probablyl talk.
* Be careful on missed things. You get to miss six things. After that,
  it starts to affect your grade.
* Tokens not yet computed.

Questions
---------

### Grade reports

What happens with late assignments?

> The wonder of tokens. Up to late deadline is one token.

> First redo on an I MP is a token.

> Second redo on any MP is a token.

> A missed class in which you did not notify me is two tokens. (You do
  not have to say why you missed class; you must just acknowledge that
  you missed class.)

Will you provide an opportunity for me to put in more tokens. I've
turned in everything late.

> Yes. Expect a new form soon.

What about missing reading responses and such?

> You get to miss up to six. After that, it affects your grade.

> You pay a token to turn them in by the late due date.

The following happened in my life: .... Can I have an extension?

> Yes.

Can you choose how your tokens are spent?

> No. Too much overhead.

### Administrative

Did Sam win all the prizes at Casino Night?

> No.

### MP4

When do we use testing?

> You use testing on the problems that say "write a test" (or three tests).

How do I create different sets of images with the same procedure (`stack`)?

> Ideally, by giving it different sets of parameters.

What should `stack` do when given a singleton list?

> For an M: Anything.

> For an E: Give just that image.

What should `stack` do when given an empty list?

> For an M: Anything.

> For an E: Anything.

> For your sense of satisfaction: A 0x0 transparent rectangle.

How complicated does the freestyle need to be?

> For an M, not very complicated. You can use the extant procedures.

> For an E, you need to write more procedures like those from each
  section (i.e., another way to turn a shape into a list of shapes,
  then a list of shapes, then a list of lists of shapes; another way
  to turn each shape in each of those structures into a different shape;
  and another way to combine these shapes in alternating ways).

What is `(list-of (list-of shape?))`?

> It checks to see whether its parameter is a list of lists of shapes.

```
> (procedure? (list-of (list-of shape?)))
#t
> (shape? thing)
#t
> ((list-of shape?) thing)
#f
> ((list-of shape?) (list thing thing))
#t
> ((list-of (list-of shape?)) thing)
#f
> ((list-of (list-of shape?)) (list thing thing))
#f
> ((list-of (list-of shape?)) (list (list thing thing)))
#t
```

> `list-of` is kind of like `cut` in that it builds new procedures. (In
  this case, predicates.)

Do I need to use `cut` with `reduce`?

> Not always. You just need a two-parameter procedure that you create
  in many different ways. `cut` is one of them. You could write a 
  separate procedure. You could use a `lambda` expression. You could
  use one that already exits.

Can we use helper procedures?

> Definitely! Ideallly, you document them.

### Lists

Is there a simpler way to do `cadddddddddddr` if the list is super long? I suppose `list-ref` or something else could do the trick, so why is `cadr` important to have?

> `list-ref` is better if you're going fairly far into the list.

> There's also a limit on how many `a`'s and `d`'s you can have in the
  `c*r`.  I think it's about six in DrRacket.

> `cadr` is much shorter than `(list-ref lst 1)`. We can also use it
  in composition and `map` and such.

Can you go over `cddr` `caar` `cdar` and `cadr`?

> Sure!

> `(cddr x)` is the same as `(cdr (cdr x))`

```
> (cddr (list 'a 'b 'c 'd 'e))
'(c d e)
> (cddr (list 'a))
. . cddr: contract violation
  expected: (cons/c any/c pair?)
  given: '(a)
```

> `(cadr x)` is the same as `(car (cdr x))` - drop one element, take the
  first element.

```
> (cadr (list 'a))
. . cadr: contract violation
  expected: (cons/c any/c pair?)
  given: '(a)
```

> `(caar x)` is the same as `(car (car x))` - take the first element, then
  take the first element of that. This is for nested lists, and the first
  element of the nested list must be a list.

```
> (caar (list (list 'a 'b) (list 'c 'd)))
'a
> (caar (list 'a 'b 'c))
. . caar: contract violation
  expected: (cons/c pair? any/c)
  given: '(a b c)
```

> `(cdar)` is the same as `(cdr (car x))` - take the first element, then
  drop the first element from what we just took. Note: The first element
  of our list must be itself a list (as in the case of `caar`).

```
> (cdar (list (list 'a 'b) (list 'c 'd)))
'(b)
> (cdar (list 'a 'b))
. . cdar: contract violation
  expected: (cons/c pair? any/c)
  given: '(a b)
> (cadar (list (list 'a 'b) (list 'c 'd)))
'b
```

> If you understand the nesting of a particular list, these can be particularly useful.

> You should not need them for MP4.

Can you go over the difference between slightly nested (also singly nested) and doubly nested lists?

> Plain list of shapes contains only shapes.

> `(list shape1 shape2 shape3)`

> A slightly nested list of shapes contains shapes and/or lists of shapes.

> `(list shape1 (list shape2 shape3))`

> A doubly nested list of shapes contains (a) shapes and/or (b) lists of shapes and/or (c) lists of lists of shapes (more or less).

> `(list shape1 (list shape2 (list shape 3)))`

Lab
---

Don't worry if you see things like `'(5 . 4)`. That's a signal from DrRacket
that you've built something that's not quite a list, but that it's still
wiling to let you work with.

You can still call `car` and `cdr` on these dotted things. **Why?** Because
the designers of Racket (and Scheme (and Lisp)) decided that you can
call `cons` on any two values, and you can call `car` and `cdr` on anything
you've built from `cons`.
