MP4 Discussion

_We're doing this live, probably switching back and forth between
DrRacket and the eboard._

_And yes, I'll be asking you questions._

Questions
---------

### Administrative

How do I pay tokens to turn something in late?

> You will be charged automatically.

How do I tell how I'm doing on tokens?

> Sam plans to update those this coming weekend.

### MP4

Are you going to record the video?

> Um ... no.  That's why we did the discussion.
