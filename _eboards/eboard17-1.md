Administrative stuff
--------------------

### Introductory notes

* Happy March!
* Happy Week Seven!
* Ramadan Mubarak.
* I realize many of you are feeling (and being) attacked by our governments,
  including both federal and state. Please remember that there are still
  many people who care deeply about you (including me).
* Sorry that I was gone for so long. The conference was a success. But I'm
  exhuasted.
* To make matters worse, my email is acting up.
* But I brought you Octocat stickers!
* Mid-semester reports are due today. Some of you will be hearing from 
  Academic Advising. You may also see Academic Alerts.

MP5

* Goal: Make abstract art by combining images.
* Primary objective: Practice with lists (and nested lists).
* Basic idea: We can think of many basic shapes as having threee
  pimary attributes: width, height, and color.
    * We can transform those attributes to make variants.
    * We can ignore the shape type and think of them as parameters to
      another function.
* Part one: Make lists of variants of the key attributes.
* Part two: Turn lists of objects into lists of other objects.
* Part three: Combine those lists of objects.
* Part four: Freestyle.

Difficult issues
----------------

_I realize that many other issues will interfere with your ability to
discuss these issues deeply. Nonetheless, I'd like to consider them a
bit, particularly since our second SoLA is immediately after fall break._

### Issue 1: Take-home exams

_You already have the background for this one._

Quick closed-eye survey: What kind of exams would you prefer?

* In-class, no computer.
* In-class, with computer.
* Take-home.

TPS: How should I address issues of inappropriate collaboration and
potential ChatGPT/Generative AI use?

### Issue 2: Struggling students

_Background: A higher percentage of students are struggling in CSC-151
than I've ever seen. And, believe it or not, I've cut back on the work
in the MPs. But there are also students who are doing fine, including
students who haven't programmed before. What should I do?_
