* Friday quiz
    * We have fifteen-minute paper quizzes every Friday at the start 
      of class.  These count as "LAs".  
    * It's fine if you don't get it right; you'll have other chances.
    * If you need extended time, please come to class at 8:00 a.m. on
      Friday. (Let me know if that doesn't work.)
    * This Friday's quiz will be on tracing/mental models of
      computation.
