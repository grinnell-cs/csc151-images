Questions
---------

### Administrative

### Reading

What's with this `'solid` in the symbols reading?

> It's something we used in the old image libary. Sam forgot to edit
  the reading.

Why do we learn symbols?

> Mostly so that you learn why we write things like `'symbol`.  We
  may return to them later in the semester.

### MP2

Lab

All of today's problems are "think and try" rather than "write a
procedure". Hence, the autograder will only check that the file
exists.
