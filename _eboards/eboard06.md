* We have fifteen-minute paper quizzes most Fridays at the start 
  of class.  These count as learning assessments (or "LAs").
* It's fine if you don't get it right; you'll have other chances.
    * I'll announce the other chances.  I'm still working on 
      scheduling those correctly.
* If you need or would like extended time, please come to class at 
  8:00 a.m. on Friday. (Let me know if that doesn't work.)
* This Friday's quiz will be on tracing and mental models of
  computation.
