### Introductory notes

* Congratulations to Men's Tennis on 21st consecutive MWC title.
* We will be forming groups for mini-project 9 on Wednesday. PLEASE COME TO
  CLASS! (It's also okay if you decide to work alone.)
* To help make the semester a bit more manageable, I will permit Es
  on second redos (except for MP1).
    * If that affects the work you put into the MP2 redo, let me know.
* I've extended the MP4, MP5, and MP6 redos another week.
* Please please please submit mentor and evening tutor evaluations.
    * <https://grinnell.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_1YUJY7nJqaj9AtU>
    * A token for everyone if at least 30 people fill it out.

### Brain dumps

* I would have liked to have seen more brain dumps of things like vector 
  recursion on the SoLA pre-reflections. 
* That could be "here's a vector recursive procedure I've written" (as
  best you recall) 
* Or "here's a pattern"
* Or just something like "the base case is normally ..."; "the
  recursive case is normally ...".
* Let's try that now. 

#### Vector recursion

#### Randomness

Tail Recursion
--------------

Would it be possible for you to run through how to do the reading
question. I understand that tail end recursion requires that all
functions and procedures be done before the recursive call, but I'm
not sure how to implement that.

### General principles

### `factorial`

Normal recursion

Tail recursion

### `make-list`

Normal recursion

Tail recursion

### `filter`

Normal recursion

Tail recursion

Questions
---------

### Administrative

### Readings

I do not quite understand how list recursion can be generalized
using tail recursion.

> We can often build up the list _backwards_ as we go, and then reverse it
  in the last step.

Are we expected to memorize the recursion templates provided in the
reading? They seem much more specific than the other procedures we
have been given templates for, which didn't necessarily require
memorizing and more so logic.

> You don't have to memorize the templates. But they may help to
  have in your notes.

What’s the difference between `letrec` and `let*`?

> `let*` defines things in sequence. `letrec` builds recursive procedures.
  You can't build a recursive procedure with `let*`.
