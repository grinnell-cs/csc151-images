Academic honesty
----------------

The Dean's office has asked us to remind you about College academic
honesty policies and about our course policies on the use of generative
AI.

> If you discover evidence that a student _may have_ violated either
the college academic honesty policy or the relevant academic honesty
policy for your course/assignment, you _must_ report that violation
to the Committee on Academic Standing (CAS) for review.

Just in case it's not clear already:

* You may not use a generative AI tool to help you do your work in this
  class. In particular, you may not have a tool generate code for you for
  mini-projects or learning assessments.
* You may not use a generative AI tool in any way for your SoLA responses.
* In writing SoLA responses, you may rely only on yourself, your notes,
  my course Web site, and the DrRacket reference.
* If you refer to my site or the DrRacket reference, you must cite your
  source (and cite it clearly).
* If you feed course materials to a generative AI tool for other purposes
  (e.g., to get a summary or to generate problems), you must ensure that
  it does not use the course materials as training data. Otherwise, you
  are violating copyright.

Questions
---------

### Administrative

Can I reflect on S&B articles from past weeks?

> Nope. Only the current week.

Is there a limit to the number of tokens I can earn in a week?

> Yes. Five.

### Project

### Running time

Can we go over the self check?

> Certainly. We'll do it as a quick TPS exercise.

> `cdr` 

> `cddr`

> `list-ref`

> `vector-ref` 

> `map`

> `range`

Have we encountered any examples of quadratic time algorithms yet?

> Yes. Many of the list recursive algorithms that use `length` to
  determine if we have only one element end up being quadratic.

### Binary Search

What exactly does 'less-equal?' check?

> It depends on what kinds of values we're storing and what order they've
  been stored. It hould correspond to the order they've been stored.

> For numbers, it usually checks if one number is less than or equal
  to another number. For strings, it normally checks if one string
  comes before another alphabetically (as determined by `string-ci<=?`).

Can we go over the self check?

> Certainly. _TPS!_ (I've also added a question.)

> a. Explain the role of the *`less-equal?`* in `binary-search`.

> b. In `binary-search`, how do we know if two values are equal?

> c. Explain the role of `midpoint`, `middle-element`, `middle-key`,
which are bound in the `let*` of `binary-search`.

> d. Describe what *`lower-bound`* and *`upper-bound`* represent.

> e. Describe why and how the *`upper-bound`* of helper `search-portion`
changes when the key we're looking for is less than the middle key.
(If it doesn't change, explain why not.)

> f. Describe why and how the *`lower-bound`* of helper `search-portion`
changes when the key we're looking for is greater than the middle key.
(If it doesn't change, explain why not.)

> g. If we double the length of the vector, what is the worst case effect
on the number of recursive calls in `binary-search`?
