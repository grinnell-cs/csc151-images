Academic honesty
----------------

The Dean's office has asked us to remind you about College academic
honesty policies and about our course policies on the use of generative
AI.

> If you discover evidence that a student _may have_ violated either
the college academic honesty policy or the relevant academic honesty
policy for your course/assignment, you _must_ report that violation
to the Committee on Academic Standing (CAS) for review.

Just in case it's not clear already:

* You may not use a generative AI tool to help you do your work in this
  class. In particular, you may not have a tool generate code for you for
  mini-projects or learning assessments.
* You may not use a generative AI tool in any way for your SoLA responses.
* In writing SoLA responses, you may rely only on yourself, your notes,
  my course Web site, the DrRacket reference, and DrRacket.
* If you refer to my site or the DrRacket reference, you must cite your
  source (and cite it clearly).
* If you feed course materials to a generative AI tool for other purposes
  (e.g., to get a summary or to generate problems), you must ensure that
  it does not use the course materials as training data. Otherwise, you
  are violating copyright.
* Hire fellow students rather than using Dall-E.

Questions
---------

### Administrative

Can I reflect on S&B articles from past weeks?

> Nope. Only the current week.

Is there a limit to the number of tokens I can earn in a week?

> Yes. Five.

### Project

### Running time

Can we go over the self check?

> Certainly. We'll do it as a quick TPS exercise. 

> **Constant**: Independent of the "size" of the input.

> **Linear**: As the size of the input goes up, the number of steps
  goes up correspondingly (e.g., if we double the input size, we 
  approximately double the number of steps).

> **Quadratic**

> `cdr` - Constant time; we just cross off the first element (or follow
  the second box).

> `cddr` -Constant time; Two steps to chop off the first two.

> `list-ref` - Linear; we have to advance one step for each position

> `vector-ref` - Constant; Sam told us so when we learned vectors.
  Our experiments show this. 

> `map` - Linear. We'll have to make a list of as many elements as
  were in the first list.

> `range` - Linear. For `(range n)`, we have to make a list of `n`
  elements.

Have we encountered any examples of quadratic time algorithms yet?

> Yes. Many of the list recursive algorithms that use `length` to
  determine if we have only one element end up being quadratic.

### Binary Search

What exactly does 'less-equal?' check?

> It depends on what kinds of values we're storing and what order they've
  been stored. It hould correspond to the order they've been stored.

> For numbers, it usually checks if one number is less than or equal
  to another number. For strings, it normally checks if one string
  comes before another alphabetically (as determined by `string-ci<=?`).

Can we go over the self check?

> Certainly. _TPS!_ (I've also added a question.)

> a. Explain the role of the *`less-equal?`* in `binary-search`.

> > Sam did this. Lets us tell whether a value is less than or equal
    to (or greater than) another value.

> b. In `binary-search`, how do we know if two values are equal?

> > If the middle key is less than the sought value and the sought
    value is less than the middle key, they must be equal.

> > Runner says "That's like double containment from linear."

> > Sam says "If a <= b and b <= a, then a and b are the same."

> c. Explain the role of `midpoint`, `middle-element`, `middle-key`,
which are bound in the `let*` of `binary-search`.

> > The index

> > Element in the middle section

> > Middle key is the key of that element; the thing we use when searching.

> d. Describe what *`lower-bound`* and *`upper-bound`* represent.

> > The left half and the right half of the section of the vector of
    interest. `lower-bound` is inclusive (that means the value we're
    searching could be at index `lower-bound`). `upper-bound` is
    exclusive (that means the value we're searching for cannot be at
    index `upper-bound` or that index `upper-bound` is outside the
    range of the vector).

> e. Describe why and how the *`upper-bound`* of helper `search-portion`
changes when the key we're looking for is less than the middle key.
(If it doesn't change, explain why not.)

> > The upper bound becomes the middle index (`midpoint`).

> > If we decreased by one `(- midpoint 1)`, we might miss an element
    because upper bound is exclusive.

> f. Describe why and how the *`lower-bound`* of helper `search-portion`
changes when the key we're looking for is greater than the middle key.
(If it doesn't change, explain why not.)

> > The lower bound becomes `(+ midpoint 1)`.

> > We use `(+ midpoint 1)` rather than `midpoint` because we know that
    it's strictly after the middle (we've already compared to the middle)

> g. If we double the length of the vector, what is the worst case effect
on the number of recursive calls in `binary-search`?

> > About one extra recursive call. We split the range of interest in half
    each time. So we quickly go from double the size to the original size.

Lab
---

When you want to use the whole value as a key, use `(lambda (x) x)`
as your `get-key` procedure.
