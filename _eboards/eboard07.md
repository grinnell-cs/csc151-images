### Introductory notes

* Covid and other illnesses remains issues.  Consider masking.  Clean
  your keyboards.
* Remember: Support is available
    * Mentor sessions: Sundays 1-2 in Science 3813 (this room).
    * Evening tutors: Sunday 3-5, Sunday-Thursday 7-10pm in 3813/3815.
    * Sam (via office hours, email, and Teams Chat).
    * Individual tutors.
* Today's "Lab Writeup" is a bit different and will be labeled something
  like "LA: Collaboration".  You will also do it outside of class (sorry).
* I've had some students ask about forming study groups.  That's fine with
  me.  I'm even happy to collect names of students interested in forming
  study groups.  If you are interested, send me your name before class on
  Monday and I'll send the list of names to anyone who sent me their name.
* I hear that my email sometimes shows up as encrypted.  It's not.
  Microsoft just writes bad software.  I've stopped digitally signing
  my email, which should address the problem.
* Office hours:
    * Please try to book using <https://bit.ly/book-samr>.
    * If I don't seem to have office hours available, it's because (a) they
      are already booked or (b) I have a conflicting obligation.  Feel free
      to use the Outlook scheduling assistant to suggest another time.
    * You can also wander by during my office hours.  If I'm free, I'll
      be there.  However, I am sometimes meeting people elsewhere.
* Please let me know if you're using the Otter.ai transcription.  If not,
  I'll probably stop using it.  (I'll still do the Teams recordings.)
* How was the quiz?

### Attending class remotely

_Given the illnesses going around campus, some of you may need to
attend class remotely.  That's fine, but please try not to make it
your norm._

a. Let me know via email that you will not be in class.

b. You are still responsible for the work.  Plan to do the lab on your own. 

c. Synchronous: If you wish, you can join the Teams Meeting during
   class.  That gives you an opportunity to hear what I say and ask 
   me questions.

d. Asynchronous: If not, I recommend that you check the recording
   and the eboard.  (You may want to check those anyway.)

e. Let me know if you need extra time on any assignments.

f. If you can't be here for a quiz, you'll need to take a makeup 
   another week.

### Friday PSA

* You are wonderful people.  Others care about you.
* Please take care of yourselves.
* Know what is appropriate for yourself; don't fall victim to perceived
  peer pressure.  Decide what's right for you and stick to it.
* Consent is essential.

About MP2
---------

Make sure to update your csc151 library.

Background
----------

* Today is our talk about pair-programming day
* Partnering works imperfectly

An Exercise
-----------

_TPS_ 

* Think TO YOURSELF
* Talk with your partner about things you heard (or thought you heard)
* Prepare to share with others

What we heard/thought?

* "partner" is not the same as "parent", although they have similar letters.
* We heard some reinforcement that "two heads are better than one", which
  we also saw in the reading.  It's nice to have someone who can unstick
  you.
* Two people with no experience can help each other.
* People seem to make assumptions about each other.  How do we avoid that?
  You have smart partners, remember that.
* Meeting new people is great.
* Don't take the keyboard from your partner.
* It shouldn't be hard to treat people with respect.

Important moral

* Partnering in CSC151 can be great.  Please make it so.

What else did you take from the readings?

* Please don't be a hitchhiker; please don't let others hitchhike
* Please don't dominate our partner; please don't let others dominate
* There are studies behind this; there's proof that working together is
  better (more efficient, better results, etc.)
* Programmers have dirty/greasy hands. (That was intended as a joke.
  Someone please laugh.)
* The act of coding with someone else can energize you / make you more
  enthusiastic about the task.
* Having to talk through a problem is helpful; talking to a rubber plant
  (or stuffed animal) is good; talking to a human being is great.
* Big idea: Driver and navigator
    * Driver types, navigator directs/advises

How should Sam establish that you've learned this?

* Observation.
* TPS.
