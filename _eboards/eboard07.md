### Introductory notes

* Covid and other illnesses remains issues.  Consider masking.  Clean
  your keyboards.
* Remember: Support is available
    * Mentor sessions: Sundays 1-2 in Science 3813 (this room).
    * Evening tutors: Sunday 3-5, Sunday-Thursday 7-10pm in 3813/3815.
    * Sam (via office hours, email, and Teams Chat).
    * Individual tutors.
* Today's "Lab Writeup" is a bit different and will be labeled something
  like "LA: Collaboration".
* I've had some students ask about forming study groups.  That's fine with
  me.  I'm even happy to collect names of students interested in forming
  study groups.  If you are interested, send me your name before class on
  Monday and I'll send the list of names to anyone who sent me their name.
* I hear that my email sometimes shows up as encrypted.  It's not.
  Microsoft just writes bad software.  I've stopped digitally signing
  my email, which should address the problem.
* Office hours:
    * Please try to book using <https://bit.ly/book-samr>.
    * If I don't seem to have office hours available, it's because (a) they
      are already booked or (b) I have a conflicting obligation.  Feel free
      to use the Outlook scheduling assistant to suggest another time.
    * You can also wander by during my office hours.  If I'm free, I'll
      be there.  However, I am sometimes meeting people elsewhere.
* Please let me know if you're using the Otter.ai transcription.  If not,
  I'll probably stop using it.  (I'll still do the Teams recordings.)

### Attending class remotely

_Given the illnesses going around campus, some of you may need to
attend class remotely.  That's fine, but please try not to make it
your norm._

a. Let me know via email that you will not be in class.

b. You are still responsible for the work.  Plan to do the lab on your own. 

c. Synchronous: If you wish, you can join the Teams Meeting during
   class.  That gives you an opportunity to hear what I say and ask 
   me questions.

d. Asynchronous: If not, I recommend that you check the recording
   and the eboard.  (You may want to check those anyway.)

e. Let me know if you need extra time on any assignments.

f. If you can't be here for a quiz, you'll need to take a makeup 
   another week.
