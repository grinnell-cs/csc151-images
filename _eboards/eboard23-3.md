Administrative stuff
--------------------

### Introductory notes

* Eid Mubarak. I wish you an Eid filled with love, joy, and unforgettable
  moments.
* Also: Happy last day of March!

### Academic honesty

I'm going to read this so that I say the same things to each section.

As I noted in my recent email, on the most recent Set of Learning
Assessments, I observed issues that appear to be violations of our
academic integrity policies.  These issues include two students
submitting nearly identical LAs when that would be highly unlikely
and one student submitting work that was likely written by ChatGPT
because it doesn't follow our normal style and involves techniques
I explicitly forbid.

Although I would much prefer to sit down with these students and
try to understand their motivations and discuss appropriate responses,
College policies require me to report them to CAS. I am sorry that
this adds extra stress to students' lives. I hope the CAS meetings
are informative rather than stressful. And I mean it. I care about you.

I realize that there may also be violations that I did not notice.
If you feel that you are fortunate in this case, please let this
be the last time.  The odds are that someone will eventually notice.

More importantly, if you feel pressure to use inappropriate resources
such as ChatGPT or a classmate, please talk to me instead. And if
a classmate asks you for your work, please suggest that they talk
to me instead. You don't help them by giving them answers.

Questions
---------

### Administrative

How do I submit a regrade request?

> There should be a button at the bottom of the screen. I'll try to demo.

How do I make up missing labs, readings, and reflections?

> You can't. However, you are permitted to miss up to six of these before
  it affects your grade.

> If you'd like me to consider an individual situation, let's talk.

Is that six collectively?

> Yes.

### Other
