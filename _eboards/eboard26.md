Diagramming structures quiz
---------------------------

_Enough people had trouble that we're going to go over it._

**Draw a box-and-pointer diagram for the following structure, named `example`.**

```
(define example
  (list (list "a" "b" null)
        (cons "a" "b")
        (cons "a" (cons "b" null))
        (cons null (cons "a" "b"))))
```

I'll be doing most of my work on the board.

Questions
---------

_I have a bunch of questions to go through.  Feel free to add your own
as we go, or wait until I've gone through them._

### Registration

Should I take CSC 161?

> Yes.

### Vectors

How should I answer "Create and define a vector, `tn3`, that contains
the values 3.14159 and 2.71828 by using the `make-vector` and
`vector-set!` procedures."

I tried `(define tn3 (vector-set! (vector-set! (make-vector 2 0) 0 3.14159) 1 2.71828))`.

> Remember!  `vector-set!` doesn't return anything.  We have to do this
  as a sequence of operations.

        (define tn3 (make-vector 2 0))
        (vector-set! tn3 0 3.14159)
        (vector-set! tn3 1 2.71828)

Why would we ever want to use a list rather than a vector if vectors 
are always faster?

> Vectors are easier to recurse through.

> Processing every element of a list and every element of a vector will
  likely take about the same amount of time.

> There are a lot of cases in which we want to make our collection
  shorter or longer.

I do not recall creating a 'random-elt' procedure or learning about
the 'random' or 'increment' procedures. Can you elaborate on how
these work and why they might be useful?

> Um ... we rearranged topics and I forgot.  We'll do randomness in
  a bit.

### Administrative

Can you tell me about the final?

> The "final" is an opportunity for you to make up any LA's you have
  missed.

> Like the SoLAs, it will be a take-home set of LAs.

> I'll distribute them on Tuesday of Finals Week.  They will be due
  at 5pm on Friday of Finals Week.

### MP5

I spent a whole day on 2e.  How could I have been more efficient?

> Stop after you are stuck for ten minutes and let your subconscious
  work on it.

> Ask for help.

> Set up an appointment with Sam.

> Decide that you'll get it on the redo.

### Other

What are some good MP strategies you've read?

* It would help to work with classmates earlier and to visit tutors
  more in the times that they are available. This would help me make
  improvements that I may not see in my code and help me make sure
  that I am on the right track.
* Starting early was helpful.
* First of all, especially as the amount of functions we know grows,
  being aware of them and what they require before starting the project
  would be handy .

Vector recursion
