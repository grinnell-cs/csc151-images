Diagramming structures quiz
---------------------------

_Enough people had trouble that we're going to go over it._

**Draw a box-and-pointer diagram for the following structure, named `example`.**

```
(define example
  (list (list "a" "b" null)
        (cons "a" "b")
        (cons "a" (cons "b" null))
        (cons null (cons "a" "b"))))
```

I'll be doing most of my work on the board.

* A list of N elements has N pairs, usually drawn in a line, with a null
  at the end.
* Any cons is represented by a single pair.
* Any pair corresponds to a single cons.

Questions
---------

_I have a bunch of questions to go through.  Feel free to add your own
as we go, or wait until I've gone through them._

### Registration

Should I take CSC 161?

> Yes.

Is there a difference between MAT-208 and CSC-208?

> Nope.  Two different numbers for the same class.

Does 161 also use mastery grading?

> It may depend on who is teaching it.  Ask the instructor.
  (Curtsinger and Nye)

Does 207 also use mastery grading?

> It may depend on who is teaching it.  Ask the instructor.
  (Rebelsky (chaos grading) and Jimenez).

### Vectors

How should I answer "Create and define a vector, `tn3`, that contains
the values 3.14159 and 2.71828 by using the `make-vector` and
`vector-set!` procedures."

I tried `(define tn3 (vector-set! (vector-set! (make-vector 2 0) 0 3.14159) 1 2.71828))`.

> Remember!  `vector-set!` doesn't return anything.  We have to do this
  as a sequence of operations.

        (define tn3 (make-vector 2 0))
        (vector-set! tn3 0 3.14159)
        (vector-set! tn3 1 2.71828)

Why would we ever want to use a list rather than a vector if vectors 
are always faster?

> Lists are easier to recurse through.

> Processing every element of a list and every element of a vector will
  likely take about the same amount of time.

> There are a lot of cases in which we want to make our collection
  shorter or longer.

> Immutable structures are easier to analyze.

I do not recall creating a 'random-elt' procedure or learning about
the 'random' or 'increment' procedures. Can you elaborate on how
these work and why they might be useful?

> Um ... we rearranged topics and I forgot.  We'll do randomness in
  a bit.

Can we go over vector recursion?

> Definitely!

### Administrative

Can you tell me about the final?

> The "final" is an opportunity for you to make up any LA's you have
  missed.

> Like the SoLAs, it will be a take-home set of LAs.

> I'll distribute them on Tuesday of Finals Week.  They will be due
  at 5pm on Friday of Finals Week.

> Sam hopes to have SoLA three graded by Monday of Finals Week.

Are you changing the MP4 redo deadline?

> Yes.  A week from Sunday.  Two weeks from yesterday.  About the 12th.

### MP5

I spent a whole day on 2e.  How could I have been more efficient?

> Remember the mantra (that I haven't told you before): "There's
  more to life than computer science."

> Stop after you are stuck for ten minutes and let your subconscious
  work on it.

> Ask for help.

> Set up an appointment with Sam.

> Decide that you'll get it on the redo.

### Other

What are some good MP strategies you've read?

* It would help to work with classmates earlier and to visit tutors
  more in the times that they are available. This would help me make
  improvements that I may not see in my code and help me make sure
  that I am on the right track.
* Starting early was helpful.
* First of all, especially as the amount of functions we know grows,
  being aware of them and what they require before starting the project
  would be handy.
* Attend mentor sessions at our new, potentially more convenient, time.
  Tuesdays at 7pm.  Room tbd.

Vector recursion
----------------

### Form one: Extracting information

_TPS activity_.

Write a procedure, `(vector-tally-odds vec)`, that takes a vector of
integers as input and returns the number of odd values in the vector.

Observation: When writing a recursive vector procedure, we normally
want to write a helper procedure that keeps track of the position in
the vector.

* We might count up from 0 to the length.
* We might count down from the length-1 to 0.

Recall: We should write documentation and tests before writing our code.

Documentation

```
;;; (vector-tally-odds vec) -> non-negative-integer?
;;;   vec : vector-of integer?
;;; Count the number of odd values in vec.
```

More documentation

```
;;; (vector-tally-odds-helper vec pos len) -> non-negative-integer?
;;;   vec : vector-of integer?
;;;   pos : non-negative-integer? (<= 0 pos len)
;;;   len : non-negative-integer? (= len (vector-length vec))
;;; Count the number of odd values in vec in the positions between
;;; pos (inclusive) up to len (exclusive).
```

Tests: How do we know if `vector-tally-odds` works?

```
(test-equal? "empty vector" 
             (vector-tally-odds (vector)) 
             0)
(test-equal? "no odd numbers"
             (vector-tally-odds (vector 2 4 2 0 2 188 -32))
             0)
(test-equal? "all odd numbers"
             (vector-tally-odds (vector 3 5 7))
             3)
(test-equal? "the last element is odd"
             (vector-tally-odds (vector 2 4 7))
             1)
(test-equal? "mixed evens and odds"
             (vector-tally-odds (vector 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10))
             4)
(test-equal? "one even element"
             (vector-tally-odds (vector 2))
             0)
(test-equal? "one odd element"
             (vector-tally-odds (vector 11))
             1)
```

On to writing ...

```
;;; (vector-tally-odds vec) -> non-negative-integer?
;;;   vec : vector-of integer?
;;; Count the number of odd values in vec.
(define vector-tally-odds
  (lambda (vec)
    (vector-tally-odds-helper vec 0 (vector-length vec))))

;;; (vector-tally-odds-helper vec pos len) -> non-negative-integer?
;;;   vec : vector-of integer?
;;;   pos : non-negative-integer? (<= 0 pos len)
;;;   len : non-negative-integer? (= len (vector-length vec))
;;; Count the number of odd values in vec in the positions between
;;; pos (inclusive) up to len (exclusive).
(define vector-tally-odds-helper
  (lambda (vec pos len)
    (if (= pos len)
        0
        (+ (if (odd? (vector-ref vec pos)) 1 0)
           (vector-tally-odds-helper vec (+ pos 1) len)))))
```

### Form two: Modifying information

Write a procedure, `(vector-round! vec)`, that takes a vector of real
numbers as input and rounds all of the values in the vector.

Once again, you'll need a helper.

Sam will document and test.  You can think about it while he does so.

```
;;; (vector-round! vec) -> void?
;;;   vec : vector-of real?
;;; Round all the values of vec in place.
```
Here's the helper

```
;;; (vector-round-helper! vec pos len) -> void?
;;;   vec : vector-of real?
;;; Round the values at positions pos (inclusive) through len (exclusive).
```

And some tests

```
(test-equal? "empty vector"
             (let ([vec (vector)])
               (vector-round-helper! vec)
               vec)
             (vector))
(test-equal? "a single integer"
             (let ([vec (vector 1)])
               (vector-round-helper! vec)
               vec)
             (vector 1))
(test-equal? "a single fraction"
             (let ([vec (vector 5/3)])
               (vector-round-helper! vec)
               vec)
             (vector 2))
(test-equal? "a bunch of values"
             (let ([vec (vector 1/3 2/3 1.1 4/3 5/3 2.2 7/3)])
               (vector-round-helper! vec)
               vec)
             (vector 0 1 1.0 1 2 2.0 2))
```

```
;;; (vector-round-helper! vec pos len) -> void?
;;;   vec : vector-of real?
;;; Round the values at positions pos (inclusive) through len (exclusive).
(define vector-round-helper!
  (lambda (vec pos len)
    (cond
      [(= pos len)
       (void)]
      [else
       (vector-set! vec pos (round (vector-ref vec pos)))
       (vector-round-helper! vec (+ pos 1) len)])))
```
