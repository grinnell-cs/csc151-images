About MP1
---------

You will have a number like 2.75 for your mini-project.

* The number to the left of the decimal point indicates how
  you did overall.  
    * 0 is (I)ncomplete
    * 1 is (R)edo
    * 2 is (M)eets expectations
    * 3 is (E)xceptional
* The number to the right of the decimal point is what the
  autograder reported.  `.99` is "everything is correct".

The graders have left comments.  

* Some may be in your code.
* Some may be on the side.
* **Please read the commments.**
* You should also check the autograder issues if you did not
  get a full score from the autograder.

You may resubmit your mini-project under the "MP1 Redo" assignment
on Gradescope for _zero_ tokens.  (In the future, those with I's will
need to spend tokens.)

* In addition to the three files, please submit an extra 
  "README.rkt" file with a comment that indicates what you changed
  since the prior assignment.

MP1 Resubmit

The only thing I missed on the last assignment was ensuring that all of
my procedures took parameters.  I added those.
