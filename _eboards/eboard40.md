Administrivia
-------------

* I have returned Friday's quizzes and updated the reports.
* Our graders will only grade your MP redos if you include a `CHANGES.txt`
  or `CHANGES.rkt` file. (That's a way for you to check the autograder
  without having them grade it.)
* If you have a compelling reason that you will need an extension on
  the SoLA, please let me know asap.
