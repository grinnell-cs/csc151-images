### Abbreviated Friday PSA

* You are awesome people.
* Others care about you. Perhaps even me.
* Please take care of yourself.
* Moderation!
* Consent is necessary (but insufficient).

SoLA 1
------

* Model: Five or Six Learning Assessments
    * Since tracing is "paper only", there will be five on SoLA 1
* Somewhat like a take-home exam.
* Online, rather than on paper. 
* Each should be similar difficulty to the quizzes you've been taking.
    * They are nonetheless capped at one hour each.
    * You can spread them out or do them all at once.
    * If you find yourself spending much more than 15 minutes on an LA, it's
      probably a sign that you don't understand the topic well enough and should
      stop.
* Topics: See [the list of learning objectives](../las/).
* **If you already have credit for a topic, such as decomposition, do
  not do the LA on the SoLA.**
* The sample LA will not be graded.

Q&A
---

### Administrative

Do I have to enter something to get a token for a mentor session?

> Yes, mentor sessions require the same reflective paragraph as any other
  token events.

How do I tell how many tokens I have?

> When I get the paperwork up to date, I'll let you know.

Can you explain how I submit a redo?

> Update your program to address the concerns raised in the first submission.

> Submit it to make sure it passes all the tests (or as many tests
  as you're satisfied passing). If it doesn't pass tests at first, keep
  fixing and resubmitting until you've achieved a desired level. (Feel
  free to ask questions along the way.)

> Once you've reached that level, submit both your updated .rkt file and a
  `CHANGES.txt` file that summarizes the changes you've made.

### Readings

I don't think we have covered using symbols much in this class yet,
is there an example of how it can be used in a procedure?

> We will and up using symbols either (a) with existing procedures
that use symbols, or (b) when we want to compare them to each other.

Could you elaborate on using symbols "to provide a mnemonic value to
a procedure"?

> We've been using strings for most of our mnemonic values, but
  here's one. `(solid-square 25 'blue)`.

How can you turn a string that has "non-numerical" characters &
numerical characters into a list of just the numbers. (e.g.,
`("200/100/30")` -> `'(200 100 30)`)

> Isn't that part of MP3?

> You could use `string-split` to break the string apart. You can
  use `string->number` to convert each part.

What is the difference between `'a`, `"a"`, and `a`?

> `'a` is a symbol. Its primary purpose is for comparing to other symbols.

> `"a"` is a string. We can compare it to other strings. We can also find
  its length, extract substrings, append it to other strings, etc.

> `a` is an identifier. It names something. (Or doesn't, if you haven't used
  it with `define`.)

### MP3

Could we go over `rgb-cyclic-subtract`?

> Sure.

Could we go over `gamma-correct-component`?

> Sure.

When should you use `cut` vs. composition?

> You generally use `cut` when you're calling another procedure and filling
  in some of the parameters, but not all of them.

> `(define blue-square (lambda (size) (solid-square size 'blue)))`

> `(define blue-square (cut (solid-square <> 'blue)))`

> If you're calling multiple one-parameter procedures in sequence, you
  will often want to use composition.

> `(pixel-map (lambda (color) (hsv->rgb (hsv-transformation (rgb->hsv color)))) (image-load "kitten.jpg"))`

> `(pixel-map (o hsv->rgb hsv-transformation rgb->hsv) (image-load "kitten.jpg"))`

Why can't I use `(max 1 (cut (- <> 1)))`? 

> Because `max` needs numbers, not procedures.

> Let's break down your steps. First you want to subtract 1. `(cut (- <> 1))`.
  Then you want to take the max of 1 and that result. `(cut (max 1 <>))`.
  We have two procedures that you want to do in sequence, so we'll use
  composition.

> `(o (cut (max 1 <>)) (cut (- <> 1)))`

> vs. `(lambda (x) (max 1 (- x 1)))`; I'm not sure cut and compose
  are that much better here.
