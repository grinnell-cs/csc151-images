Academic honesty
----------------

The Dean's office has asked us to remind you about College academic
honesty policies and about our course policies on the use of generative
AI.

> If you discover evidence that a student _may have_ violated either
the college academic honesty policy or the relevant academic honesty
policy for your course/assignment, you _must_ report that violation
to the Committee on Academic Standing (CAS) for review.

Just in case it's not clear already:

* You may not use a generative AI tool to help you do your work in this
  class. In particular, you may not have a tool generate code for you for
  mini-projects, learning assessments, reading responses, meta-cognitive
  reflections.
* You may not use a generative AI tool in any way for your SoLA responses.
* In writing SoLA responses, you may rely only on yourself, your notes,
  my course Web site, the DrRacket reference, and DrRacket.
* If you refer to my site or the DrRacket reference, you must cite your
  source (and cite it clearly).
* If you feed course materials to a generative AI tool for other purposes
  (e.g., to get a summary or to generate problems), you must ensure that
  it does not use the course materials as training data. Otherwise, you
  are violating copyright.

Questions
---------

### Administrative

Can I reflect on S&B articles from past weeks?

> Nope. Only the current week.

Is there a limit to the number of tokens I can earn in a week?

> Yes. Five.

### Project

### Running time

Can we go over the self check?

> Certainly. We'll do it as a quick TPS exercise. 

> **Constant**: Independent of the "size" of the input.

> **Linear**: As the size of the input goes up, the number of steps
  goes up correspondingly (e.g., if we double the input size, we 
  approximately double the number of steps).

> `cdr`  - Constant. Throwing away the first element should not depend
  on the number of elements in the list.

> `cddr` - Constant. Two constant operations are still constant.

> `(list-ref lst n)` - Linear in `n` because we have to keep taking the 
  `cdr` of the list `n` times.

> `(vector-ref vec n)` - Constant. Sam said that we can access the value
  directly and the size doesn't matter. (Experiments confirm this.)

> `(map fun lst)` - Linear in length of list. We have to apply the 
  procedure to each element; if we add elements, we have more steps to do.

> `(range n)` - Linear in `n`. The have `n` elements in the list, so as
  `n` increases, the number of times we call `cons` to build the list
  increases directly.

Have we encountered any examples of quadratic time algorithms yet?

> Yes. Many of the list recursive algorithms that use `length` to
  determine if we have only one element end up being quadratic.

### Binary Search

What exactly does `less-equal?` check?

> It depends on what kinds of values we're storing and what order they've
  been stored. It hould correspond to the order they've been stored.

> For numbers, it usually checks if one number is less than or equal
  to another number. For strings, it normally checks if one string
  comes before another alphabetically (as determined by `string-ci<=?`).

Can we go over the self check?

> Certainly. _TPS!_ (I've also added a question.)

> a. Explain the role of the *`less-equal?`* in `binary-search`.

> > We compare the sought key to the key of the middle element, which
    lets us determine whether we're found that key or need to search
    in the left half or the right half.

> > As Sam just said, we know that the elements are ordered by `less-equal?`.

> b. In `binary-search`, how do we know if two values (`a` and `b`)
are equal?

> > If a is less than or equal to b and b is less than or equal to a,
    then a equals b. (For our particular code, we say that if key
    is less than or equal to middle-key and middle-key is less than or
    equal to key, than key = middle-key.)

> > We shouldn't use `equal?`. It's not in the one on the reading, and
    we're trying to use that one. Or ... some versions of `less-equal?`
    give a different notion of equality. For example `string-ci<=`.
    `(equal? "Lilli" "lilLI")` returns false. However
    `(and (string-ci<=? "Lilli" "lilLI") (string-ci<=? "lilLI" "Lilli"))`
    returns true.

> c. Explain the role of `midpoint`, `middle-element`, `middle-key`,
which are bound in the `let*` of `binary-search`.

> > `midpoint` - the index of the middle of the section of interest.

> > `middle-element` - the value at that index

> > `middle-key` - the key of that element (e.g., the first name if
  we've sorted by name and are searching by name)

> d. Describe what *`lower-bound`* and *`upper-bound`* represent.

> > They represent the area of the vector that we're searching.
    Initially, they represent the whole vector. As we look in the
    middle, we can usually throw away about half of the elements
    in the area we're searching.

> > `lower-bound` is inclusive. That means that we (usually) need to 
    consider the value at index `lower-bound`.

> > `upper-bound` is exclusive. This means that we should not consider
    the value at index `upper-bound` (but should consider things
    with smaller indices)

> e. Describe why and how the *`upper-bound`* of helper `search-portion`
changes when the key we're looking for is less than the middle key.
(If it doesn't change, explain why not.)

> > We use `midpoint`.

> > We do not use `(- midpoint 1)` because the upper-bound is exclusive.
    It won't look at `midpoint` based on our policy. If we set `upper-bound`
    to `(- midpoint 1)`, that says "we'll never look at the value at
    position `(- midpoint 1)`, and we know nothing about the value at
    the position.

> f. Describe why and how the *`lower-bound`* of helper `search-portion`
changes when the key we're looking for is greater than the middle key.
(If it doesn't change, explain why not.)

> > We use `(+ midpoint 1)` rather than `midpoint` because the lower-bound
    is inclusive, and we know that the value at `midpoint` is not what
    we're looking for.

> g. If we double the length of the vector, what is the worst case effect
on the number of recursive calls in `binary-search`?

> > It's just one more. In that one more, we cut it in half so it's back
    to the original size.
