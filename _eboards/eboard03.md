### Introductory notes

* Our class site is still under development.  Let me know if you find
  things missing, including images.
    * Those slash things on the syllabus usually indicate something
      that I plan to post.  If they show up for a reading, let me know.
* Normal office hours are in-person (unless you'd prefer to do them
  remotely).
* Apologies: I have some significant personal issues that may make me less
  available in person in the coming weeks.  I will do my best to be available 
  via email and Teams chat.
    * These issues have also put me behind.  Apologies for that, too.
* I have made two updates to the schedule:
    * We're not doing a quiz this Friday; I don't think we've covered enough.
    * I've moved the homework pre-assessment to Sunday night.
* I'm told that all the accounts are now set up.  Let me know if you have difficulty
  logging in.

### HW 1

* _Warning_: Most of this is based on material we will cover Friday and Monday.
* I thought you'd benefit from seeing it early so that you can start thinking
  about it.

### Upcoming Token activities

Academic

* Convocation, Thursday, 11:00 a.m.  President Harris.

Cultural

Peer

* (No more volleyball scrimmages; let's limit ourselves to competitions.)
* Volleyball game on Friday at 5:00 against Bethany and Dominca.
* Football a week from Saturday, 1pm, against Rippon.

Wellness

### Upcoming work

* One reading for Friday; Complete the reading assignment on Gradescope by 
  Thursday night.
* Lab writeup(s) due before class on Friday.
* Homework one released (probably not doable yet).
* Homework one pre-assessment due on Sunday night (these will usually be due
  on Friday nights; I like you to think about assignments early).

Debrief on lab from Monday: Learning Scheme
-------------------------------------------

* It's generally a bad idea to skip ahead in the lab.
* **The origin of the short and long versions.**  My colleagues who
  first taught the course wrote the long versions (or at least
  the original versions of the long versions).  When I started
  teaching, I decided you might do better with short instructions.
  But it's a nice example of different ways of thinking about writing
  algorithms/instructions.
* I see that many of you have three screens (our main screen plus two
  laptops).  Please do your work on the MathLAN workstation and just
  use your laptop for bringing up the lab/reference materials.
    * If I see you running DrRacket on your laptop, I may attempt
      to defenestrate aforementioned laptop.
