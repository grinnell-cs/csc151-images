Questions
---------

### General

_It's better to ask general questions via Teams Messages, email, or
the Q&A channel than on the reading responses. You'll get quicker
answers._

That [passwordreset](https://passwordreset.grinnell.edu) detour was, um,
interesting, but not necessarily relevant. Do you often go off on tangents?

> Squirrel!

Where do I submit tokens?

> Stay tuned. The token assignments should be available on Gradescope
  by Monday.

From the Q&A channel, it sounds like some of the section 2 students have
finished MP1 already. Should I be worried?

> Not at all. It's not due until next Wednesday. I just want to make
  sure you read it and think about it today.

### On the readings

How does the order of the numbers correspond to the dimensions of
the shapes (length/width etc.) and can this be changed (such that
the first number corresponds to height instead of length or vice
versa)

> For shapes that have different width and height, the first number is
  usually the width and the second is the height.

> The documentation (see the Reference link) will usually give you
  the details. (I'm still working on the documentation.)

> You can write a new procedure that takes the parameters in a different
  order (at least you will be able to after you do Monday's reading).

Does top-down coding necessarily have to continue from the largest
procedure to the most simple, or if you understand what the code
should look like, could you start working out the 'middle bit'
first?  

> Top-down usually starts only at the top. In practice, most people
  work in multiple directions at once.

I would like more examples of top-down and bottom-up.

> We'll do some in lab (at least I think we will).
