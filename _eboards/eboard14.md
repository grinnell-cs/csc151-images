Administrative stuff
--------------------

* Yay! I have both hearing aids. My hearing has now returned to 
  mediocre instead of awful.
* Prof. Perlmutter and I are still discussing what to do about the
  SoLA 1 issues. Stay tuned. I've released the graded SoLAs for
  the time being so that you can see how you've done. However, if the
  "dorm lounge" policy goes into effect, those will change.
    * Since the parties have not come forward, I'll just remind them
      that the "I won't report you to the committee on academic
      standing" policy doesn't hold when I identify you.
* I'm still waiting for a replacement hearing aid. Expect me to continue
  to exhibit difficulty hearing. (It's worse today because my other hearing
  aid didn't charge. I may ask those up front to help out.)
* MP4 should be released tomorrow night.
* Reminders:
    * If I don't respond on Teams within 12 hours (weekdays), feel free
      to DM me again.
    * If I don't respond to email within 24 hours (weekdays), freel free
      to email me again.

Questions
---------

### Administrative

Will Sam update tokens so that we can enter more?

> Sure. It's on my agenda for tonight. (Really this time.)

### MP2

Can you give us a diagram for outlined right triangles?

> Sure. I'll add it to my agenda for tonight. (Really this time.)

### MP3

### Lists

When do we use `apply`?

> When we have a procedure that expects a bunch of parameters and we've
  somehow managed to put all of those parameters into a list.

> Most frequently, when we have a procedure that expects "as many parameters
  as you give it" and a list. We might apply `+`, `string-append`, 
  `beside`, `above`.
