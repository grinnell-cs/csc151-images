_Approximate overview_

* Administrivia
* About the SoLA
* Questions
* Lab

Administrivia
-------------

* Extra copies of the mentor session handout are in the back of the 
  room. 
* Reminder: Mentor sessions are an opportunity to extend your learning
  (and, on occasion, get practice for SoLAs).  They are not a place
  for homework help.
* Reminder: Individual tutors are available (free).  I will likely be
  recommending individual tutors for students after I'm done grading
  the SoLA.
* The SoLA will have only six problems; neither tracing nor collaboration
  will appear on the SoLA.
    * I will keep giving tracing quizzes until everyone has passed them.
    * I will give you the opportunity to redo your collaboration LA if
      you don't pass it.  (Sorry for the delay in grading it.)
* There is a "Sample LA" on Gradescope.  That's intended for you to be
  able to see the time counter and other aspects of online LAs.
* If you have parents visiting for family weekend, you are welcome to
  bring them to class on Friday.  (Let me know in advance in case I have
  to find chairs.)

_Ask questions.  It's part of self gov.  If you have questions, others
likely do, too._

### On administrative stuff

### On `cut` and `compose`

### On "the big three"

Lab
---

Person closest to the board is A.  Person furthest from board is B.

Make sure to talk to your partner about work habits, knowledge, etc.

(Sam wonders if anyone is watching this in recording form.)

What's the difference between `cut` and `section` (which we saw in the 
reading)?  They seem similar.

> Mostly just surface syntax.  Both build a new procedure by filling in
  some of the parameters of an extant procedure.

> `(cut (circle <> "solid" "blue"))`

> `(section circle <> "solid" "blue")`

> `cut` has the advantage that the expression you're cutting is a bit
  more obvious.

> `section` has fewer parens and doesn't break order of evaluation.

> Congratulations!  You are the first class to get `section`.

What's happening on exercise 4?

> Think about what reduce does.
