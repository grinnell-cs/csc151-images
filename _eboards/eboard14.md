* About the SoLA
* Questions

Administrivia
-------------

* Reminder: Mentor sessions are not intended as homework help; they are
  an opportunity to extend your learning.
* Reminder: Individual tutors are available (free).  I will likely be
  recommending individual tutors for students after I'm done grading
  the SoLA.
* The SoLA will have only six problems; neither tracing nor collaboration
  will appear on the SoLA.
    * I will keep giving tracing quizzes until everyone has passed them.
    * I will give you the opportunity to redo your collaboration LA if
      you don't pass it.  (Sorry for the delay in grading it.)
* There is a "Sample LA" on Gradescope.  That's intended for you to be
  able to see the time counter and other aspects of online LAs.
* If you have parents visiting for family weekend, you are welcome to
  bring them to class on Friday.  (Let me know in advance in case I have
  to find chairs.)
