MP2 and style/formatting
------------------------

The way you organize code affects how readable it is.

is
.
```

Try to follow the basic patterns we are using.  Some of the more
important principles follow.

Move on to new lines (a) in "standard" places (e.g., before the
`(lambda`) and (b) when lines are getting too long.

Make sure to hit Ctrl-I before submitting (or regularly).  This command
reindents your code according to standard principles.  (However, it
does not insert new lines.)  (Ctrl-I is very useful for finding
mismatched parentheses.)

End parentheses belong at the end of the last line of code, not on
a line by themselves.

No nested defines.  (No putting `define` in the middle of your procedure.)
(This is a Grinnell stylism.)

Questions
---------

_Ask questions.  It's part of self gov.  If you have questions, others
likely do, too._

### On Boolean values and conditional expressions

### On the mini-project

### Miscellaneous

### On administrative stuff
