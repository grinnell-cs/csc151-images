**Warning** This class is being recorded (and transcribed).

_Approximate overview_

* Administrivia
* Questions
* A quick review of one of the recent double dagger questions
* Lab

Administrivia
-------------

* Grade summaries distributed over the weekend.  
    * Let me know if you have questions.
    * I haven't charged "redo costs" yet.
    * I've turned in some academic alerts.
* Folks seem to be struggling with recursion.  I think it's because we
  haven't had enough practice.  So we'll be practicing with list recursion
  one more time today.
* Please don't assume that I'll read your reading questions promptly.  Ask
  questions in class if you're not sure.
    * I'll go over numeric recursion questions on Wednesday.
* Today's lab is new.  Fingers crossed.
    * I may need a few minutes at the start of class to check over the
      autograder.

Questions
---------

### Administrative

Will I be charged a token for redoing an MP?

> See [the token policies](https://rebelsky.cs.grinnell.edu/Courses/CSC151/2023Fa/handouts/tokens) for details.

> If you got an R or an M, there is no charge for the first redo
  (unless you turn it in late).

> If you got an I or did not turn in the mini-project, you must
  spend one token to turn in the redo (and a second if you turn it
  in late).

> Second redos cost two tokens.  If you didn't turn in the first
  redo, the second redo stil counts as a second redo.

Will I be charged a token for redoing an LA?

> No.

When will I have the opportunity to make up an LA I missed on SoLA 1?

> On SoLA 2.

When will I have a chance to make up the LAs on the big three and list
recursion?

> The original plans was that if you missed an LA on a quiz, you'd get to
  try again on the SoLA.  However, in a lapse of judgement, I seem to 
  have started to give weekly quiz makeups.  You can try then or you can
  wait for the next SoLA.

When will I have a chance to make up the LA on documentation?

> On the next SoLA.

What is this Friday's quiz topic?

> Local bindings (and using local bindings to simplify code).
