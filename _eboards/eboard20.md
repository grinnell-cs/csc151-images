Administrivia
-------------

* Grade summaries distributed over the weekend.  
    * Let me know if you have questions.
    * I haven't charged "redo costs" yet.
* Folks seem to be struggling with recursion.  I think it's because we
  haven't had enough practice.  So we'll be practicing with list recursion
  one more time today.
* Please don't assume that I'll read your reading questions promptly.  Ask
  questions in class if you're not sure.
    * I'll go over numeric recursion questions on Wednesday.
