**Warning! You are being recorded** (and transcribed) (provided the technology
is working correctly).

_Start of class instructions_

* Grab a plastic-coated business card. It should have a computer name
  and location.
* Identify where the corresponding computer is.
* Return the card to the jar.
* If you arrive first, start the lab.
* When both partners arrive, introduce yourselves.

For the future: I'm happy to reserve a (somewhat random) seat at
the front of the classroom for those who need a front seat as an
adjustment or accommodation.  Just let me know.

_Approximate overview_

* Administrative stuff; no attendance [10--15 min]
* Debrief on Monday's activity [5--10 min]
* Set up for MathLAN, partner one [10 min]
* Set up for MathLAN, partner two [5 min]
* Lab [45 min]

Administrative stuff
--------------------

### Introductory Notes

* Hi, I'm still Sam (or SamR).
* Our class mentor is still Maddy Thompson.
* Fingers crossed that the instructor workstation works better today.
* You will find that I call on students randomly using a set of cards
  with your names on them.
    * I use this process to give you practice "thinking on your feet",
      as it were.
    * I also use this process to help everyone realize that they are
      not the only one who is puzzled.
    * And I use the process to push you a bit.
    * Feel free to say "I'm not sure" or "I'd prefer not to answer."
    * If you don't want to be called on in class, please let me know.
* The `csc151` library (which you'll learn about in lab today) is
  updated daily. Each time you sit down to work, you should try to 
  update the version you have.
    * Also: Let me know when you encounter bugs or unexpected behavior.
* Reminder to self: Demo Gradescope.
* Reminder to self: Asking questions
* Reminder to self: Vygotsky's zone of proximal development.

    * _Note that readings responses are generally due in the evening. If
      you turn them in by 8pm or so, it's more likely that I'll read
      them before class._

Questions on the readings
-------------------------

Debrief on sandwich making activity
-----------------------------------

We will use _Think-Pair-Share_ (TPS) for this.

### Grouping students

Getting students into card groups was somewhat chaotic.  I intentionally
don't provide an algorithm, and it showed.  What would be a better
algorithm for getting card groups together?

### Other lessons

Here are the lessons you supplied.

Lab 1: Setting up Linux
-----------------------

This lab appears in the Schedule.  Each person will do this separately, with
the other person helping.

In past years, some students have had to edit the launcher to use
`firefox` instead of `firefox-esr %u`.  I'm not sure why people end up
with different launchers.

Lab 2: Learning Scheme
----------------------

* You'll do most of the second lab collaboratively.
* If I see you running DrRacket on your laptop, I may attempt
  to defenestrate aforementioned laptop.
* We'll be around to help.  At least I think we will.  Sam is panicking
  about various things right now.
* If you finish early, start the readings for the next class.
* If you didn't finish, that's okay.  DM (Chat) me on Teams to let me know.
* You will be turning in your answers to exercises 7--9.  At least we
  think you will.

Debrief (if time)
-----------------

_There usually isn't time, but I'm an optimist._
