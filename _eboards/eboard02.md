**Warning** This class is being recorded.

_Getting started_ (this will be our normal start-of-class sequence)

* Grab a card.  The card will have a computer name and a location.
* Remember the name and location.
* Drop the card back in the jar.
* Navigate to the computer.
* If you arrive first, start the lab.
* When both partners arrive, introduce yourselves.

For the future: I'm happy to reserve a (somewhat random) seat at
the front of the classroom for those who need a front seat as an
adjustment or accommodation.  Just let me know.

_Approximate overview_

* Administrative stuff; no attendance [10--15 min]
* Debrief on Monday's activity [5--10 min]
* Set up for MathLAN, partner one [10 min]
* Set up for MathLAN, partner two [5 min]
* Lab [45 min]

Administrivia
-------------

### Introductory notes

* I'm still Sam (or SamR).
* Our mentors are still Ellie and Ella (or vice versa).
* I tend to respond faster to Direct Messages (Chat) on Teams than email.
* We'll talk about Gradescope on Wednesday.  (Our mentors will remind me
  if I do not.)
* We will be using a different implementation of Scheme than the other
  sections of 151.
* I will do my best to post a link to the Otter.ai transcript on Teams,
  in the recordings channel.
* Our class site is still under development.  Let me know if you find
  things missing, including images.

### Concerns

Here's an approximate distribution of concerns as of this morning.

Questions on the readings
-------------------------

Debrief on Prior Class
----------------------

We will do this as a _Think/Pair/Share_ (or just TPS) activity.

* Think for a minute to yourself.
* Discuss the idea with your partner.
* Share with the broader classroom.

**Getting students into card groups was somewhat chaotic.  I intentionally
don't provide an algorithm, and it sometimes shows.  What would be a better
algorithm for getting card groups together?**

Lab 1: Setting up Linux
-----------------------

This lab appears in the Schedule.  Each person will do this separately, with
the other person helping.

In past years, some students have had to edit the launcher to use
`firefox` instead of `firefox-esr %u`.  I'm not sure why people end up
with different launchers.

Lab 2: Learning Scheme
----------------------

* You'll do most of the second lab collaboratively.
* However, setup needs to be individual, so each of you will do the
  first lab individually, first one person and then the other.
* We'll be around to help.  At least I think we will.  Sam is panicking
  about various things right now.
* If you finish early, start the readings for the next class.
* If you didn't finish, that's okay.  DM (Chat) me on Teams to let me know.


Debrief (if time)
-----------------

_There usually isn't time, but I'm an optimist._

**The origin of the short and long versions.**  My colleagues who
first taught the course wrote the long versions (or at least
the original versions of the long versions).  When I started
teaching, I decided you might do better with short instructions.
But it's a nice example of different ways of thinking about writing
algorithms/instructions.

I see that many of you have three screens (our main screen plus two
laptops).  Please do your work on the MathLAN workstation and just
use your laptop for bringing up the lab/reference materials.

* If I see you running DrRacket on your laptop, I may attempt
  to defenestrate aforementioned laptop.
