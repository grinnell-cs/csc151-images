A bit about binary search
-------------------------

Questions
---------

### Administrative

### Analysis

Could you go over the double-dagger problems?

> `cdr` - **constant** time. Following the `cdr` arrow from a pair
  always takes the same time, whethere it's followed by one element
  or a thousand elements.

> `cddr`

> `list-ref`

> `vector-ref`

> `map`

> `range`

### Searching

Could you go over d and e?

> Done. I hope.

### MP 8

### SoLA 4

Lab!
