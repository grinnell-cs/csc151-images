What happens if we leave early for Turkey break?

  Friday or on SoLA 3 or 4.

> You should let me know.

About the project
-----------------

Group project.  We'll talk about group formation last.

Liberal arts project (?).  Use your programming and image-making skills
to help you better understand either (a) art, (b) nature, or (c) other
things that are image-based.

Pick a starting image or set of images that exist already.

Write a procedure, `(image-series n width height)`, that makes a
`width`-by-`height` image.  It should make a different image for each
`n` between 0 and 999, inclusive.  They should all be similar.

Use at least two of the three key image-design techniques: shapes,
bitmaps, (image-compute ...).

Use recursion at least twice.

See the instructions for more details.

### Questions?

Can we use procedures from other mini-projects?

> Of course, provided you cite them.

How should the `n` influence the result?

> However you wish.

Do the time logs go in the one file?

> Yes.

Are there other things to submit?

> Yes.  Images and a PowerPoint slide deck.

What should the presentation have?

> Here's the image we're starting with.

> Here's how we approached the project.

> Here's the result.

> And look at this awesome code.

How should we share the code?

> Shared OneDrive folder?

> Find times to work together.

How big should groups be?

> 1--4, with a preference for 3--4.

> Yay!  Everyone formed a team of 4.
