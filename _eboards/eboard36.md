Questions
---------

### Administrative

Do we have to stay in class for project work time?

> No. But you do have to do the hour or so of work at some time. I thought
  this would be an easy time to ensure that everyone is available.

What happens if I don't have all the LAs from phases one and two done after next week's quizzes?

> In most cases, you'll try on SoLA 3 (week 14) or SoLA 4 (finals week)

> The only exceptions are (a) collaboration, (b) ethics, and (c) tracing
