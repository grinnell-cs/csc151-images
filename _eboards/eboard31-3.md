    * Consent is essential, but not sufficient.

Readings
--------

_TPS_

What are the big ideas? (There are at least three.)

* You can write procedures that create new procedures. (This can be
  powerful, but also dangerous.)
* We can write the big three procedures! (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`)
     * You have gained in knowledge. Yay!
* You can write procedures that take other procedures as parameters.
  (In fact, that's true of `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`.)
* The ability to take and return procedures suggest that Racket is a
  "higher order" programming language.
  
How would you write `filter`? (Recursively)

```
(define filter
  (lambda (pred? lst)
    (if (null? lst)
        lst ; or null
        (if (pred? (car lst))
            (cons (car lst) (filter pred? (cdr lst)))
            (filter pred? (cdr lst))))))
```

Suppose we had the list `'(1 2 3 4 5)` and we wanted to filter the odd
numbers.

```
     (filter odd? '(1 2 3 4 5))
     ; Not empty, pred holds
---> (cons 1 (filter odd? '(2 3 4 5)))
     ; Not empty, pred fails
---> (cons 1 (filter odd? '(3 4 5)))
     ; Not empty, pred holds
---> (cons 1 (cons 3 (filter odd? '(4 5))))
     ; Not empty, pred fails
---> (cons 1 (cons 3 (filter odd? '(5))))
     ; Not empty, pred holds
---> (cons 1 (cons 3 (cons 5 (filter odd? '()))))
     ; Empty
---> (cons 1 (cons 3 (cons 5 '())))
---> (cons 1 (cons 3 '(5)))
---> (cons 1 '(3 5))
---> '(1 3 5)
```

### Questions

Questions
---------

### Administrative

Will dictionaries be on SoLA 3?

> No.

### Readings

Can we go over the self check?

> Sure.

Lab

### `right-section`

`(right-section binproc val)` is supposed to take a two-parameter procedure
and a value, use the value as the second (right) parameter of `binproc`,
and return a new procedure that expects the first first parameter.

Very similar to `(cut (binproc <> val))`.

For example, 

* `(right-section + 3)` -> `(lambda (x) (+ x 3))`
* `(right-section - 4)` -> `(lambda (x) (- x 4))`
* `(right-section make-list "Scar")` -> `(lambda (n) (make-list n "Scar"))`

No type checking is necessary.
