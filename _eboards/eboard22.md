### Spring Break PSA

Questions
---------

### Administrative

When is MP4 redo due?

> Sunday, April 7, 2024.

### MP5

### Recursion

Is it possible to develop a recursive procedure that does not
necessarily have to use null in order to make the call "finite",
meaning it would eventually come to a result?

> Certainly. We can stop when two elements are left in a list, or
  when we find a particular element in al ist, or â€¦

> On Wednesday, we'll see recursion based on numbers.
