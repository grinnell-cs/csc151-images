Administrative stuff
--------------------

* Greetings on the celebration of the revealing of the Quran
* Welcome to our prospective student!
* I hope you are doing okay with the time change.
* For reasons I will discuss, I will not be in class on Wednesday or
  Friday. You will have guest teachers both days.
    * I hope you have a wonderful break!
* I posted the 100th assignment to Gradescope last night. (I don't think
  you can see them all.)
* MP4 returned.

* And it's joyful.

Questions
---------

### Administrative

When is MP4 redo due?

> Sunday, April 7, 2024.

Can we have more tokens?

> You should be able to submit more on the new tokens page.

What about the old tokens?

> I'll move them over during spring break.

I turned in two tokens under the old system. Where should I start in the
new system?

> On token three.

How do we tell how many tokens we have?

> After spring break? Sorry.

### MP5

Do `gridify-hv` and `gridify-vh` work?

> Yes, they should work once you've written your procedures.

Why do I see a dot when I'm making a list of shapes or images (e.g.,
in `simple-shapes` or `variants`?

> Think about about your base case. Each of these procedures returns
  a list. Are you returning a list in the base case?

### Recursion

Is it possible to develop a recursive procedure that does not
necessarily have to use null in order to make the call "finite",
meaning it would eventually come to a result?

> Certainly. We can stop when two elements are left in a list, or
  when we find a particular element in al ist, or â€¦

> On Wednesday, we'll see recursion based on numbers.

### Local Bindings

Can we define local helper procedures with `let`?

> Definitely!

> If you want local recursive procedures, you need `letrec`.

### Miscellaneous

Can you describe `ormap`?

> `ormap` takes the for `(ormap pred? lst)`, and it scans the list to find
  an element for which `pred?` holds. If it finds such an element, it returns
  true. If it fails to find such an element, it returns false. If it hits
  an element for which `pred?` generates an error, it throws an errow.

```
> (ormap odd? (list 1 2 3))
#t
> (ormap odd? (list 2 4 6))
#f
> (ormap odd? (list 2 4 "three" 6))
. . odd?: contract violation
  expected: integer?
  given: "three"
```

Where does the `or` come into play?

> Think of it as `(or (pred? (list-ref lst 0)) (pred? (list-ref lst 1)) (pred? (list-ref lst 2)) ...)`

Can you explain why you want us to put `let` statements outside the `lambda`?

> I could, but you'll learn why in lab.

Why do we have `ormap`?

> We have `andmap` and `ormap` because `and` and `or` are not really functions
(they have a different evaluation order), so they need a special form.

Lab
---

For exercise 4, what are you looking for?

```
(define make-change
  (lambda (cents)
    (let* ([quarters (quotient cents 25)]
           [centsible (- cents (* quarters 25))]
           [dimes (quotient centsible 10)]
           [centsless (- centsible (* dimes 10))]
           ...)
      (list quarters dimes nickles pennies))))
```

For exercise 5, can we use the built-in tracer?

> You could try, but I'd prefer that you do things by hand. Even though
  I wrote the built-in tracer, I'm not completely confident in it.
