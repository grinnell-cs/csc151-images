Administrative stuff
--------------------

### Introductory notes

* I am out of Otter.ai minutes, so there is no Otter transcription/summary
  for any classes today.
* In case you hadn't figured it out yet, you have an hour to complete an
  LA from the time that you start the LA, even if you close your computer
  or log out of Gradescope.
* Remember that you can take both/all quizzes. And you can stay until
  thirty minutes after the end of class to complete them.

Q&A
---

### Administrative

When will we get grades on today's quizzes?

> Sam hopes to have those done tonight.

What should we submit for redos?

> The updated `.rkt` file.

> Any images required by the assignment.

> A text (preferably) or PDF file name `CHANGES.txt` (or `CHANGES.pdf`)
  that summarizes what problems you had the first time and what changes
  you've made. It can also be `CHANGES.rkt`.

I accidentally opened an LA early because I didn't understand the
timing. Can you help me?

> Yes, I can reset them if you DM me.

If I pass today's makeup tracing quiz, do I have to do it online?

> You can only pass in-person tracing quizzes. If you don't pass today's,
  you can try again next week.

What about documentation?

> Documentation is Phase 2, so it's not on this SoLA?

### Booleans and conditionals

Why does the equality predicate `=` not also count as a comparator?

> Comparators are supposed to tell you whether one thing comes before 
  another. `=` does not.

Could you go over the `not` procedure and its uses?

> Sure.

> `(not expression)` -> Gives the "opposite" result of the expression.

```racket
;;; (anything-but-string? val) -> boolean?
;;;   val : any?
;;; Returns false if `val` is a string and true otherwise.
(define anything-but-string?
  (lambda (val)
    (not (string? val))))
```
I read and reread the truish breakdown and was still confused. What
are examples of statements that would result in a truish output?
What would produce not false, but then not be true?

> `(not #f)` is always true, `#t`.

> However, there are values that are neither `#f` nor `#t`. For example,
  `"hello"` or the result of `(+ 2 3)`. We consider those "truish". If
  we use them as the test/guard in a conditional, instead of an error,
  we'll see them treated as if they were true.

Is there a "nothing" value in Scheme and is it truish or false?

> Yes. It's the result of `(void)` and is treated as truish (because it
  is something other than false).

What do we need to understand when making the distinction between
keywords and procedures?

> You should understand that the order of evaluation is different
  (and, preferably, what that order is).

> Normal (e.g., `(+ exp1 exp2 exp3)`): Evaluate `exp1`, then `exp2`,
  then `exp3`, then apply the sum operator.

> Lambda (i.e., `(lambda (params) exp)`): To apply a lambda expression,
  we substitute the arguments for the parameters in the expression and
  then evaluate the expression using the rules we're writing. But if
  we just write the lambda expression, it does (almost) nothing. It
  only builds a procedure.

> If (i.e., `(if test consequent alternate)`): Evaluate the test.
  If the test is truish, evaluates the consequent and returns its value.
  If the test is false, evaluates the alternate and returns its value.

> And (i.e., `(and exp1 exp2 exp3)`): Evaluate `exp1`. If it's false,
  stops and returns false. Otherwise, goes on to the next expression.
  If all of the expressions are truish, returns the value of the last
  expression.

> Or (ie.., `(or exp1 exp2 exp3)`): Evaluate each expression in turn
  until one of them is truish. Returns that value. If none of them
  are truish, returns false.

When you get to `median-of-three`, you might find `min` and `max` useful.
