Administrative stuff
--------------------

### Introductory notes

* For clarity, here are the kinds of help you can obtain.
    * If you don't understand a topic, you can (a) attend mentor sessions,
      (b) sign up for a meeting with Sam, (c) TM Sam, (d) ask for an
      individual tutor (if this is a recurring issue and you're attending
      mentor sessions). You can also (e) ask the evening tutors if they are
      not busy. 
    * If you need help with a mini-project, you can (a) ask the evening
      tutors, (b) TM Sam, (c) sign up for a meeting with Sam, (d) ask
      in class (provided it's a general question). _Individual tutors are
      not supposed to be for homework help!_
    * You can also ask a fellow student about these issues (except on
      LAs).

Questions
---------

### Administrative

### Mini-project 7

Mini-project 7 took me more than six hours, but I'm done. Could you make
it easier for my classmates who haven't started yet?

> Yes. Parts three and four are now both optional. You must do three OR
  four for an E. You must still do parts one, two, and five.

### Randomness

_Please read over these on your own._

Will we use this procedure on any upcoming mini projects?

> Probably MP8.

Expand on why random is useful in other procedures.

> Random is generally useful when we want to simulate things. As
  we'll see in lab, it can also be useful for some "fun" things.  

Random returns an integer, but each integer in the 'returnable' range of the given parameter for random has an equal chance of returning. How could you alter this chance? Say you had `(random 5)` but you wanted 1 to have an 80% less chance to return than the rest of the integers?

You can't change the behavior of `random`. But you can write procedures that provide different distributions. For example, we could build a vector of the possible values, each in the proportion we want, and randomly select from that vector.

```
(define biased-random
  (let* ([vals (vector 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 3 4 4 4 4 4)]
         [valslen (vector-length vals)])
    (lambda ()
      (vector-ref vals (random valslen)))))
```

How does it work that `(+ (random 6) 1)` increases the range to 6?

> It doesn't. It increases the upper-bound of the range to 6, but it
  also increases the lower bound of the range to 1. The largest number
  `(random 6)` can produce is 5. If we add 1 to 5, we get 6. The
  smallest number `(random 6)` can produce is 0. If we add 1 to 0, we
  get 1.

What's a pseudo-random generator?

> It's an algorithm for generating random numbers. Since it's an
  algorithm, it's officially "predictable". However, it produces
  values in something close to a random distribution.

What's so special about the number 4,294,967,296?

> It's `(expt 2 32)`, the largest number you can represent with 32 bits. Where did you see it?

Lab
---

Side note: This is one of my favorite labs because (a) there's a really
bad pun in the lab, (b) those who get to the later problems have fun,
and (c) the "Rolling Rolling Rolling" reminds me of two of my favorite
performances (John Belushi and band performing "Rawhide" in _The Blues
Brothers_ and any of the many Tina Turner performances of "Proud Mary").
