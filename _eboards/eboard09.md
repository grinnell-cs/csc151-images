Questions
---------

### Administrative

I think my grade on MP1 is incorrect.

> Teams Message your concern to me and I'll take a look.

> You can also visit me in the office.

Can I visit your office hours even if I haven't booked them?

> Certainly. However, priority at any time goes to those who have booked
  those hours.

> If I'm talking to someone, you should let me know that you're here.
  (Sometimes a fifteen-minute slot goes long if no one has reserved
  the next slot. Those waiting get preference at that point.)

What if I can't make any of your office hours?

> Teams Message me to propose another time.

> You can find my general schedule [on my Web site](https://rebelsky.cs.grinnell.edu/schedule.html). I prefer that you request during Project Time, CSC-151-02 time (I don't always attend), or Class Prep time.
