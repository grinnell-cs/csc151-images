Administrative stuff
--------------------

* We have class 9 on the 9th. Yay!
* There are many sick people on campus. Consider masking.
* Feel free to send me questions on Teams, even at night. If I'm available,
  I'll answer them quickly. If not, I'll try to answer them the next day.
* Warning! You will sometimes see the next class's eboard on our site.
* I'm glad that so many of you attended the mentor session last night.
  I'll remind you that mentor sessions are much like class in that we
  expect you to participate actively. Mentors won't lecture.

Questions
---------

### Administrative

I think my grade on MP1 is incorrect.

> Teams Message your concern to me and I'll take a look.

> You can also visit me in the office.

Can I visit your office hours even if I haven't booked them?

> Certainly. However, priority at any time goes to those who have booked
  those hours.

> If I'm talking to someone, you should let me know that you're here.
  (Sometimes a fifteen-minute slot goes long if no one has reserved
  the next slot. Those waiting get preference at that point.)

What if I can't make any of your office hours?

> Teams Message me to propose another time.

> You can find my general schedule [on my Web site](https://rebelsky.cs.grinnell.edu/schedule.html). I prefer that you request during Project Time, CSC-151-02 time (I don't always attend), or Class Prep time.

### Readings (Pair Programming)

_I will not take questions on the readings until the discussion._

Background
----------

* Today is our "talk about pair programming" day.
* In our experience, partnering works imperfectly.
    *
    *
* We use this day to help make partnering better.
* We will return to these issues throughout the semester.
