Administrative stuff
--------------------

### Introductory notes

* Happy Penultinmate Week! (At least for students.)
* Congratulations to our baseballers who made it to the playoffs!
  (Also tennisers, trackers and fielders, ping-pongers, and others I've missed.)
* Please plan to attend class Wednesday for project presentations.
* Please plan to attend class Friday for wrapup activities.
    * If you are unable to make it to class on Friday (e.g., because your
      team is traveling), please plan to come early on Wednesday (Section 1)
      or stay late on Wednesday (Sections 2 and 3).
* This is my last week of bookable office hours. I'll be available
  by appointment during finals week.
* If you took the most recent diagramming structures quiz, you should have
  received an email message from Gradescope at about 9pm on May 1 entitled 
  _[CSC-151] The "last" diagraming structures quiz_. You should read
  that email message.

Questions
---------

### Administrative

I've missed way too many reading responses, labs, and/or metacognitive
reflections.  Can you just waive the penalty for missing those
things?

> Each of these is important to your learning in its own way.

> Reading responses ensure that you're ready for the lab. At least they
  are supposed to.

> Metacognitive reflections help you develop as a learner.

> Labs help you learn the material. They may even be the primary way
  in which you learn the material.

Background: What is computer science?
-------------------------------------

_TPS_

Typical running times
---------------------

* **Constant time**: Independent of the size of the input
* **Logarithmic**: Goes up by a constant amount each time you double
  the size of the input.
* **Linear**: Doubles each time you double the size of the input.
* **Quadratic**: Quadruples every time you double the size of the input.
* **Exponential**: Approximately doubles every time you add another element.

The problem of sorting
----------------------

Designing sorting algorithms
----------------------------

_TPS: Design a sorting algorithm that we will enact._

Inputs: A list or vector of values + a way to compare any two values

Output: The same group of values, now in order. (for lists, we'll output
a new list; for vectors, we'll change them in place)

Implementing sorting algorithms
-------------------------------

_TPS: Document_

```
;;; (sort ???) -> ???
```
