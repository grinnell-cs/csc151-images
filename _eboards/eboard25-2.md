* I have not yet had time to get the quizzes graded. They should be graded
  and available on Gradescope by Saturday night. I'll bring the hardcopies 
  on Monday.
* I overslept this morning, so some links are missing from the eboard. I'll
  add them after class.

### Friday PSA

* You're awesome. Please try to remain that way.
* Please be moderate in what you do. Cake to excess is bad.
* Consent is essential but not sufficient.

Mini-Project 7
--------------

* Key idea: Play with an underlying representation of images.
* Part one: Explore rows and columns.
* Part two: Using the idea to make a variant of images.
* Part three: More variants.
* Part four: Steganography.
* Part five: Freestyle.
* _You only need to do one of parts three and four for an M._

I do?

Vectors
-------

### Introductory comments

_TPS_

### What is a vector?

* It's like a list. That is, it represents a sequence of values.
* Unlike lists, you change them.

### What are the key vector operations?

* `(vector-set! vec index new-value)` - Puts the new value at the given
  position. (We don't know of a list equivalent.)
* `(make-vector length val)` - Makes a vector of the given length containing
  that many copies of the value. (Similar operation for lists: `make-list`).
* `(vector val0 ...)` - Makes a vector containing those values. (Similar
  operation for lists: `list`.)
* `(vector-length vec)` - Tells you the length of the vector (size, number
  of elements in the vector). (Similar operation for lists: `length`.)
* `(vector-ref vec pos)` - Extract an element from the vector. (For
  lists, we have `list-ref`).

### What are the three key C list operations?

* `(cons val lst)` - Creates a new list by adding an element to the 
  front of `lst`. We did not learn an equivalent operation for vectors
  (there isn't really one).  Vectors have a fixed length.
* `(car lst)` - Returns the element at index 0. We use `vector-ref`
  to achieve a similar goal.
* `(cdr lst)` - Returns a "new" list without the first element of `lst`.
  Sam did not teach us a similar vector operation (because there isn't
  really one).

### What distinguishes vectors from lists?

* Unlike lists, you change vectors.
* Unlike lists, vectors have a fixed length.
* It's much faster to find the `i`th element of a vector than a list.
    * For a list, we need to cdr through the list `i` times and then
      call `car`.
    * For a vector, we can quickly compute a new memory location.

### Why would you use one rather than the other?

* If you're going to be doing lots of indexing (not in sequential order),
  vectors are much better.
* If you're going to be adding and removing elements, you probably want
  to use a list.
* If you're going to be changing elements, you should use vector.

### How does `vector-set!` differ from other procedures we've seen?

* It doesn't return anything.
* It changes one of its parameters.
* `(define tn3 (vector-set! (vector-set! (make-vector 2 0) 0 7) 1 11))`
    * The inner `vector-set!` returns nothing, and so the outer `vector-set!`
      doesn't have a vector to modify.
* If you don't name the vector and use vector-set!, the vector is lost!

### Programming with vectors

_How might programming with vectors differ from the other kinds of
programming we've done? (Think especially about recursive programming
and `vector-set!`.)_

* Historically, we have sequenced operations by nesting.
  `(proc3 (proc2 (proc1 vall)))`.
* Since `vector-set!` doesn't return anything, we must sequence by
  writing things one after another.
* ```
(vector-set! vec 0 "zero")
(vector-set! vec 1 "one")
```

### Some exercises

```
;;; (vector-tally-odd vec) -> integer?
;;;   vec : (vector-of exact-integer?)
;;; Count how many odd numbers are in the vector.
(define vector-tally-odd
  (lambda (vec)
    (vector-tally-odd-helper vec 0)))

;;; (vector-tally-odd-helper vec index) -> integer?
;;;   vec : (vector-of exact-integer?)
;;;   index : exact-integer? (between 0 and (vector-length vec))
;;; Tally the odd element in vector starting at the given index.
```

* We'll need to use `vector-ref` to get elements out of the vector.
* We'll need to index to run from 0 (inclusive) to `(vector-length vec)`
  (exclusive)
* If we need to keep track of the index, we'll need a helper procedure.
* We're going to need to use recursion.
    * Base case test: Index is greater than or equal to length vector
    * Base case value: 0
    * Recursive call
    * Pre-recursion or post-recursion step

```
(define vector-tally-odd-helper
  (lambda (vec index)
    (if (>= index (vector-length vec))
        0
        (+ (if (odd? (vector-ref vec index))
             1
             0)
           (vector-tally-odd-helper vec (+ 1 index))))))
```

```
;;; (vector-increment-odd! vec) -> void
;;;   vec : (vector-of exact-integer?)
;;; Add one to all the odd numbers in the vector.
```

### Q&A (from reading and elsewhere)

Can we go over how to make `tn3`?

> Sure.

Why is `tn1` immutable?

> Rules of Scheme: If you make a vector with the octothorpe, you get an immutable vector.

In our first self-check, `tn1`, `tn2`, and `tn3` all contain the same
elements. Why is `tn1` not equal to `tn2` or `tn3`?

> `tn1` is immutable. `tn2` and `tn3` are mutable. Immutable and mutable
  structures are not equal.

What is the 'file' type referred to in the reading? Are we talking about an actual .rkt file here?

> Whoops. Sometimes we cover how to build text and data files in the course. We didn't this semester.

I don't think I'm clear on what you mean by "DrRacket displaying the value of the vector" in Check 1. Does that just mean the result of calling `tn1`, `tn2`, etc?

> Yes, displaying the value in a vector is just what you get when you type the identifier.
