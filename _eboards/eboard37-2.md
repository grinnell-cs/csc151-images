Academic honesty
----------------

The Dean's office has asked us to remind you about College academic
honesty policies and about our course policies on the use of generative
AI.

> If you discover evidence that a student _may have_ violated either
the college academic honesty policy or the relevant academic honesty
policy for your course/assignment, you _must_ report that violation
to the Committee on Academic Standing (CAS) for review.

> This is **boldface** and _italicized_.

Just in case it's not clear already:

* You may not use a generative AI tool to help you do your work in this
  class. In particular, you may not have a tool generate code for you for
  mini-projects, learning assessments, or reading responses.
* You may not use a generative AI tool in any way for your SoLA responses.
* In writing SoLA responses, you may rely only on yourself, your notes,
  my course Web site, the DrRacket reference, and DrRacket.
* If you refer to my site or the DrRacket reference, you must cite your
  source (and cite it clearly).
* If you feed course materials to a generative AI tool for other purposes
  (e.g., to get a summary or to generate problems), you must ensure that
  it does not use the course materials as training data. Otherwise, you
  are violating copyright.

Questions
---------

### Administrative

Can I reflect on S&B articles from past weeks?

> Nope. Only the current week.

Is there a limit to the number of tokens I can earn in a week?

> Yes. Five.

Will there be more quizzes?

> No.

I screwed up diagramming structures for the fourth time. Do I have any
option given that it's not on the SoLA?

> Yes. Read your email.

### Project

### Running time

Can we go over the self check?

> Certainly. We'll do it as a quick TPS exercise. 

> **Constant**: Independent of the "size" of the input.

> **Linear**: As the size of the input goes up, the number of steps
  goes up correspondingly (e.g., if we double the input size, we 
  approximately double the number of steps).

> `cdr` - constant, because taking off the first element is independent
  of the size of the list.
 
> `cddr` - constant, because it takes two steps to remove the first two
  elements

> `list-ref` - linear, because you have to call cdr `n` times to reach
  the `n`th element.

> `vector-ref` - constant, because Sam said that's how vectors work
  (and experiments validate that claim)

> `map` - linear, because the length of the result is the same as the
  length of the input list, so as the input list grows, so does the
  cost of building the result list.

> `range` - linear, because (use math), it builds a list, and the larger
  `n` is, the longer the list becomes.

Have we encountered any examples of quadratic time algorithms yet?

> Yes. Many of the list recursive algorithms that use `length` to
  determine if we have only one element end up being quadratic.

### Binary Search

What exactly does 'less-equal?' check?

> It depends on what kinds of values we're storing and what order they've
  been stored. It hould correspond to the order they've been stored.

> For numbers, it usually checks if one number is less than or equal
  to another number. For strings, it normally checks if one string
  comes before another alphabetically (as determined by `string-ci<=?`).

Can we go over the self check?

> Certainly. _TPS!_ (I've also added a question.)

> a. Explain the role of the *`less-equal?`* in `binary-search`.

> > It helps us decide how to shrink the portion of the vector we're
    searching. We compare the key at the middle to the sought value.

> > As Sam just told us, it describes the ordering of the values in
    the vector.

> b. In `binary-search`, how do we know if two keys (e.g., `a` and `b`)
are equal?

> > If a is less than or equal to b and b is less than or equal to a,
    they are equal.

> > We don't just use `equal?` because we may be looking at other aspects
    (e.g., we may be doing case-insensitive comparisons; `equal?` does
    case-sensitive comparisons).

> c. Explain the role of `midpoint`, `middle-element`, `middle-key`,
which are bound in the `let*` of `binary-search`.

> > `midpoint` - index of the middle element (middle of the range of interest)

> > `middle-element` - element at that index

> > `middle-key` - key of the middle element; 

> d. Describe what *`lower-bound`* and *`upper-bound`* represent.

> > There is a range of indices of interest. `lower-bound` is bottom
    side of the range and `upper-bound` is the top end of the range.

> > `lower-bound` is inclusive; that means that the element we are 
    searching for can appear at index `lower-bound`.

> > `upper-bound` is exclusive; that means that the element we are
    searching for can NOT appear at index `upper-bound` (it may even
    be out of the range of valid indices)

> e. Describe why and how the *`upper-bound`* of helper `search-portion`
changes when the key we're looking for is less than the middle key.
(If it doesn't change, explain why not.)

> > The new `upper-bound` becomes `midpoint`.

> > We know that it's not above the midpoint.

> > Why isn't it `(- midpoint 1)`? Since `upper-bound` is exclusive,
    that means we're excluding `(- midpoint 1)` and we have no knowledge
    of the value at that position.

> f. Describe why and how the *`lower-bound`* of helper `search-portion`
changes when the key we're looking for is greater than the middle key.
(If it doesn't change, explain why not.)

> > The new lower bound becomes `(+ midpoint 1)`.

> > We do `(+ midpoint 1)` rather than `midpoint` because the lower bound
    is inclusivve and we know that it's not equal to the midpoint, so we
    want to exclude the (useless) midpoint.

> g. If we double the length of the vector, what is the worst case effect
on the number of recursive calls in `binary-search`?

> > It adds only one because we immediately split, and then recurse,
    so one step brings us back to the old size.

Lab
---

If you want to treat the whole value as the key, use `(lambda (x) x)` 
as your `get-key` procedure.
