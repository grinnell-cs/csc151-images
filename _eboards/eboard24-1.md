Questions
---------

### Administrative

How do I submit a regrade request?

> There should be a button at the bottom of the screen. I'll try to demo.

How do I make up missing labs, readings, and reflections?

> You can't. However, you are permitted to miss up to six of these before
  it affects your grade.

> If you'd like me to consider an individual situation, let's talk.

Is that six collectively?

> Yes.
