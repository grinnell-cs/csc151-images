Administrative stuff
--------------------

### Introductory notes

* Welcome to any Prospective Students. Please introduce yourself and
  (optionally) ask a question.
* Beware! Friday the 13th falls on Sunday.
* The graders have noted an increase in students using a style of 
  defining procedures that I do not permit. It looks something like
  this. `(define (proc param param param) body)`.
    * As I've noted before, if you define procedures without `lambda`,
      `cut`, composition, or aliasing, I won't credit them. (In some
      cases, I will report you to CAS.)
    * So _please use the correct form_.
* Don't forget to press the **Register** button before the end of the day!
    * Yes, there's certainly room in 161.

Questions
---------

### Administrative

### Mini-project 7

### Dictionaries etc.

_Whoo! Almost no questions!_

How is a hash table different from a list of pairs?

> It provides more efficient access to elements (particularly when you 
  have a lot of elements).

> It lets us hide the underlying details. We think about the two or
  three key operations. 

> * Add an element `(hash-set! hash key value)`.
> * Look up an element `(hash-ref hash key)`.

We talked some about the look up time of a list vs a vector. Does
a hash have a look up time and method more similar to vectors or a
list?

> Mutable hash tables have lookup time similar to vectors.

Can you clarify what the common form means in terms of the new-hash 
procedures?

> When we want similar things to be treated the same, we must explicitly
  convert them to a form in which they are extactly the same if we want
  to use hash tables.

> Basically, ignoring case and non-letters (if I recall correctly).
