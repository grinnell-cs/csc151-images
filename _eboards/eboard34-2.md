Administrative stuff

### Introductory notes

* Welcome to our prospective/admitted students! Please introduce
  yourself and ask a question. "Grinnellians ask hard questions and

  people used to say.
* I'll be guest teaching classes next Tuesday, so office hours will only
  be 8:30--9:45.
* As always, if you'd like to meet to me outside of office hours, let 
  me know.

### Friday PSA

Questions
---------

### Administrative

### Project

How much time should we log for Wednesday?

> 30 minutes.

### Trees

Why do we use `null` for the first child if the node only has one
child, as opposed to using it for the second child?

> We can use the empty tree for either child if it has only one
child; it depends on how we want to arrange the tree.

Why is Data Analyst under head of marketing if Data Analyst comes
first in the nested list? Shouldn't be under "Head of Engineering"?

> Because the person who drew the picture screwed up and I didn't notice.

Why is the default a binary tree and not more elements?

> That's a great question. I suppose there are a variety of reasons.
  A binary tree is the simplest "interesting" tree (unary trees are
  just lists). We can also simulate any n-ary tree with a binary tree.

What does `match` refer to?

> Damn! I thought I'd gotten rid of that. `match` is a procedure that's in Scamper but we don't use in our section of 151.

What is the point of binary trees? is it just an easier way of
visualizing list within lists?

> We don't have to represent binary trees as nested lists. We could,
for example, use structs. In general, they end up being a useful
way to represent some kinds of information (as we'll see next class).

How can we apply this idea of binary trees into coding to solve problems?

> It's mostly a way to think about how we organize information. As we noted,
  there are hierarchical structures that occur in many situations. In addition,
  as we'll see next class, trees can let you organize information to
  improve how we address some algorithmic problems, like searching.
