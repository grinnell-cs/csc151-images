Questions

### Administrative

About the project
-----------------

Underlying perspective

* You know how to program (at least a bit).
* We can apply our programming knowledge to support our learning of other
  fields.
* Since we've learned about making and manipulating images, we can apply
  that to trying to understand works of art.
* Can we better understand the design decisions an artist has made by
  creating variants of their work?
* We'll pick a work, write a procedure that makes 1000 variants, see what
  the variants tell us.

Expectations

* `(image-series n width height)`
    * `n` is an integer between 0 (inclsive) and 1000 (exclusive).
    * You can choose three things to vary, make ten variants of each.
      (Ones digit chooses one variation aspect, tens chooses another,
      hundreds chooses a third.)
    * All your variations need not be perfectly distinguishable, but
      some should be.
* At least two (non-trivial) procedures that use recursion. 
* At least two forms of image making or image manipulation.
* Work in a group of size 1 to 4.
* Give a five-minute presentation on the project two weeks from today.
* Spend at least five hours per person over the next 1.5 weeks.
    * Includes: Writing code, writing informative stuff, preparing a talk.
    * NO MORE THAN TEN HOURS!
* Tell me a bit about your work.

Work time

_We'll also have work time next Wednesday._

Initial tasks:

* Make sure you have each others' contact info.
* Set up meeting times.
* Pick a team name.
* Look through af Klint's work (hardcopy, online) to see if there are
  some that speak to you (or at least that you want to do).
* Start considering variations you might make.
* Start considering how you might achieve different parts of the image.
