Some notes on "How to prepare for an LA" from last time.

* Not being tired / getting enough rest was surprisingly helpful.
* Going to the mentor session helped.
* Doing practice problems seemed to have the greatest effect.
* Just looking at the practice problems gave me a better sense of what to
  expect.
* I took careful notes on the readings.  Having notes to refer to makes
  the LAs much easier.
* I reviewed the problems I got wrong on the previous SoLA and quizzes.
  Correcting the mistakes I made helped me understand the material.
* I spent more time than usual brain-dumping about each topic, which helped 
  refresh my memory. 
* I was also careful to read the instructions a few times to make sure I 
  was doing what was asked.
* Rereading the readings and labs to refresh my brain.
* Looking back at lab exercises, which are often similar to what appears
  on LAs and quizzes.
* Working on it early in the day.
* Taking a break.
