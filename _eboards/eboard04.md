Questions
---------

### Quizzes

Why do you have us do quizzes on paper rather than the computer?

> Lots of reasons. First of all, there are (usually) fewer computers 
  than students. More importantly, for the paper quizzes, my goal is
  not that you get the syntax perfect. Rather, I want to see that you
  can get the ideas right. The stressors of taking a quiz on the
  computer are also different.

What should I do if I did not receive credit for this quiz?

> There will be a makeup this Friday. If you don't receive credit
  on the makeup, you can try again on the first set of learning
  assessments (SoLA) in a few weeks. (The SoLA will be on the
  computer.)

### Administrative

What's the best way to check what work is due?

> The daily eboards are most likely to have links to everything.

> Gradescope will have the things you need to turn in, but Gradescope
  is sometimes overwhelming.

> The schedule lists most things, but won't always have links.

### Notes

* You are best off right clicking on the link to the Racket file and 
  saving it in an appropriate place.
* As you may have noticed, the autograder cares that you have the right
  file name and that you give your values the right names. Following
  these kinds of guidelines is good practice.
