_Approximate overview_

* Lots of administrative stuff, including attendance
* What is "computer science"?
* A group activity, more or less
* Debrief on activity (possibly Wednesday)

Administrative stuff
--------------------

_Please take a playing card, if you didn't already._

### Introductory Notes

* Hi, I'm Sam (or SamR).
* Our class mentor is Maddy Thompson
    * Maddy will introduce themselves.
* The class Web site is at 
  <https://rebelsky.cs.grinnell.edu/Courses/CSC151/2024Sp/>.
    * I will email you the link.
    * The class Web site is (always) a work in progress. 
* CSC-151 is *an introductory course in computer science*.
    * You can succeed (and even excel) with no prior experience.
    * We approach material differently than many other intro courses;
      prior experience may help, but it may also hinder.  For example,
      we will not let you re-assign variables.  (Don't worry if you
      don't know what that means.)
* CSC-151 is *a community*.  We come from multiple cultures and backgrounds.
  Treat each other with respect and learn to appreciate what each person
  can contribute.
    * We will return to this issue and the associated learning outcomes
      throughout the semester.
* I type our online class notes in a format called "markdown".  You should
  find it relatively readable.  It permits me to make "nice" Web pages.
    * Sam: Don't forget to show off today's eboard.
    * **Don't just rely on my notes**; There is good evidence that taking 
      your own notes helps you learn.
* I will record our class sessions (audio only + mediocre transcript)
  using Otter.ai.  I will try to remember to post the link to Teams.
  Remind me if I don't.

### Other introductory stuff

* The CS department maintains a mailing list.  Let me know if you'd like
  to be added.  (Conveniently, the question is on our intro survey.)
* We provide supplies in this classroom to support you in working
  and learning.
    * Small cards to serve as flashcards, which are a good learning technique.
    * Also large post-it pads that are gridded.
    * And pens.
* I prefer to have you book office hours.  First priority in any time
  slot goes to those who book.  https:/bit.ly/book-samr
* You'll learn more introductory stuff when you read the syllabus.

### Apologies

* I am old.  My hearing is not great, even with hearing aids.
* Our Web site is not as up to date as I'd like.  But it will be.  Soon.
  Ish.
* I am traditionally bad at names+faces.  I will be worse with masks.  It
  will take me some time to learn your names.
* My family is ill. I may be absent at unexpected times (esp. during office 
  hours).
* More to come ....

### Upcoming activities

Guidelines

* You can earn "tokens" (more info follows) for attending designated
  academic events or supporting your classmates in their pursuits.
* Attend (or watch recording within a day or so) and **record a one-paragraph 
  reflection within three days afterwards**.
* Only those activities I list count.
    * But you can suggest others.
* Links might appear in the Announcements channel on MS Teams.
* Unless otherwise specified, these each earn one token.

Wellness

Misc

### Upcoming work

* [Read the Web site and answer questions](../assignments/syllabus).
* [Tell me about yourself](../assignments/intro-survey).
* Read things in preparation for the second day of class and report on those things
    * [An intro to the course](../readings/fundhum-intro)
    * [Our Linux workstations](../readings/linux)
    * [Algorithm building blocks](../readings/algorithm-building-blocks)
    * [The DrRacket programming environment](../readings/drracket)
    * [An abbreviated introduction to Racket](../readings/racket-intro)
    * _Note that readings responses are generally due in the early evening
      so that I can review them before class._

### Attendance

* Sam will (attempt to) call you by first name.
* You will respond with 
    * "Hi, my name is FIRST LAST.
    * (Optional pronouns.)
    * I prefer to be called NAME.
    * If you must call me by last name, please call me Mr./Ms./Mx. LAST NAME.
    * This semester , I am excited about ....
    * _Optionally, ask me a question. You'll also have another chance later._
* Note: For the first few weeks of class, please say your name each time
  you ask or answer a question.

### Excited About

### Q&A

What is computer science?
-------------------------

* Computer science is the study of *algorithms* and *data structures*
    * Algorithms: Sets of (unambiguous) instructions.
    * Data Structures: Ways to organize information.
* We study algorithms by  ...
    * writing algorithms to accomplish certain tasks.  
      (E.g., Organizing or searching information.)
        * identify problems
        * generalize / simplify 
        * write instructions that allow "you" to solve them
    * analyzing their efficacy.
    * writing systems that implement those instructions (e.g., hardware 
      or languages).
    * considering their effects on individuals or society.
* We study data structures in similar ways.
* Most of this class will be writing and thinking about sets of
  instructions in an artificial language (aka a programming language).
    * We use an artificial language because artificial languages
      can be designed to be less ambiguous.  (Also easier for the
      computer to follow.)

Exercise
--------

_Practice writing algorithms!_

* Form a group with other people with the same card.
* Write instructions so that Sam can make a ??? and ??? sandwich
  using the box o' sandwich supplies.
    * Assume that Sam is clueless.
