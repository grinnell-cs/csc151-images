* A group activity, more or less
* Debrief on activity (possibly Monday)

Administrative stuff
--------------------

* _Please take a playing card, if you didn't already._
* Sit where you'd like, within reason.
* If you don't know the people next to you, introduce yourselves.

### Introductory Notes

* Hi, I'm Sam (or SamR).
* Our class mentors are Ellie Seehorn and Ella Berman.
    * Ellie and Ella will introduce themselves.
    * Mentors are here to support your learning. 
    * They run mentor sessions to help you learn the class material.
    * They are not here for homework help; we do have evening tutors
      available for help.
    * Mentor sessions are great; and should be part of your learning.
      "Other people have great questions."  And you get to spend more
      time with your awesome classmates.
    * Mentor sessions may improve your grade.  (Data suggests that there
      is a correlation between mentor sessions and higher grades.)
    * Closer to you; remember struggles better than your faculty do.
    * They can mentor on things beyond just the class.
* The class Web site is at 
  <https://rebelsky.cs.grinnell.edu/Courses/CSC151/2023Fa/>.
    * I will email you the link.
    * The class Web site is (always) a work in progress. 
* CSC-151 is *an introductory course in computer science*.
    * You can succeed (and even excel) with no prior experience.
    * We approach material differently than many other intro courses;
      prior experience may help, but it may also hinder.  For example,
      we will not let you re-assign variables.  (Don't worry if you
      don't know what that means.)
* CSC-151 is *a community*.  We come from multiple cultures and backgrounds.
  Treat each other with respect and learn to appreciate what each person
  can contribute.
    * We will return to this issue and the associated learning outcomes
      throughout the semester.
* I type our online class notes in a format called "markdown".  You should
  find it relatively readable.  It permits me to make "nice" Web pages.
    * Sam: Don't forget to show off today's eboard.
    * Don't just rely on my notes; There is good evidence that taking your 
      own notes helps you learn.
* I will record our class sessions (audio only + mediocre transcript)
  using Otter.ai.  I will try to remember to post the link.  Remind me
  if I don't.

### Other introductory stuff

* The CS department maintains a mailing list.  Let me know if you'd like
  to be added.  (Conveniently, the question is on our intro survey.)
* I'm switching back to in-person teaching after a year of leave.
  Please excuse me if I'm a bit rusty.
* We provide supplies in this classroom to support you in working
  and learning.
    * Small cards to serve as flashcards, which are a good learning technique.
    * Also large post-it pads that are gridded.
    * And pens.
* I prefer to have you book office hours.  First priority in any time
  slot goes to those who book.  https:/bit.ly/book-samr
* You'll learn more introductory stuff when you read the syllabus.

### Apologies

* I am old.  My hearing is not great, even with hearing aids.
* Some combination of age + meds + temperature in room + air movement in
  room means I sweat a lot.
* Our Web site is not as up to date as I'd like.  But it will be.  Soon.
  Ish.
* I am traditionally bad at names+faces.  I will be worse with masks.  It
  will take me some time to learn your names.
* More to come ....

### Upcoming activities

Guidelines

* You can earn "tokens" (more info follows) for attending designated
  academic events or supporting your classmates in their pursuits.
* Attend (or watch recording within a day or so) and **record a one-paragraph 
  reflection within three days afterwards**.
* Only those activities I list count.
    * But you can suggest others.
* Links might appear in the Announcements channel on MS Teams.
* Unless otherwise specified, these each earn one token.  

Events

* Academic events: Scholar's convocation next Thursday at 11am with Pres.
  Harris.
* Volleyball Scrimmage 5:15 today in Darby

    * [An intro to the course](../readings/fundhum-intro)
    * [Our Linux workstations](../readings/linux)
    * [Algorithm building blocks](../readings/algorithm-building-blocks)
    * [The DrRacket programming environment](../readings/drracket)
    * [An abbreviated introduction to Scheme](../readings/scheme-intro)
    * _Note that readings responses are generally due in the early evening
      so that I can review them before class._

### PSA 1

* Be careful.  COVID is here.

### Friday PSA

    * (Optional pronouns.)
    * I prefer to be called NAME.
    * If you must call me by last name, please call me Mr./Ms./Mx./Sr./Sra./Srta./... LAST NAME (San).
    * This semester , I am excited about ....
    * _Optionally, ask me a question. You'll also have another chance later._

### Q&A

Why does Sam like CS?  Or does he?

: Sam likes torturing students and CS is the best way to do so.  It doesn't
  matter whether or not he likes it.
: I like CS because I enjoy building things and I can build things on computers
  easier than in the physical world.  I also like CS because it scratches my
  math itch of problem solving without requiring me to write proofs.

What is your favorite part of teaching this course?

: Watching students learn.
: Getting people excited about computer science.
: Meeting new students.

What project are you most proud of

: Curriculum for this class.
: My children.
: A few of my scupltures.
: MIST: A weird art making program that I wrote with students.

What's something we don't know about Grinnell?

: Grinnell used to have a natural history museum.  As a prank, a group of students stole a walrus from the museum and buried it on campus.  No one knows where it is, but it may still be there.

: At the turn of the last century, there was an early-fall event in which first-years (freshman) and second-years (sophomores) engaged in campus-wide fisticuffs.  Around 1909 the students decided to discontinue the practice (in spite of the town's appreciation of watching) and swore so on a rock.  About three years ago, John Whittaker in anthropology and a group of students found the rock which had been buried.

What has changed about Grinnell since Sam arrived in the fall of 1997?

: Our student body is much more diverse.  Great!
: Our endowment is significantly higher (from $1bil to $2.5bil)
: Students are more willing to exhibit wealth
: Fewer pajamas in class
: But Grinnellians stay the same as awesome people who care about each other.

Is cereal a soup?

: No.  Cereal is dry.
: Milk and cereal (or water and cereal) is a more complex question.

What's the silliest project Sam has ever worked on?

: Sam is an incredibly serious person, never makes jokes, and never does
  anything silly.
: In an old version of this class, we had a kitten picture that we manipulated
  in horrendous ways.

Why are you still excited about teaching?

: Awesome students.  It's fun to watch them learn and grow.
: Cool topic.
: Intellectual challenge to design a successful class (or even an unsuccessful one; you learn from failure)

Best dining hall food?

: Quinoa tacos

Does Sam prefer Mac or windows?

: Sam uses Macs and Linux
: Sam believes windows should be defenestrated

What is computer science?
-------------------------

* Computer science is the study of *algorithms* and *data
  structures*
    * Algorithms: Sets of (unambiguous) instructions.
    * Data Structures: Ways to organize information.
* We study algorithms by  ...
    * writing algorithms to accomplish certain tasks.  
      (E.g., Organizing or searching information.)
        * identify problems
        * generalize / simplify 
        * write instructions that allow "you" to solve them
    * analyzing their efficacy.
    * writing systems that implement those instructions (e.g., hardware 
      or languages).
    * considering their effects on individuals or society.
* We study data structures in similar ways.
* Most of this class will be writing and thinking about sets of
  instructions in an artificial language (aka a programming language).
    * We use an artificial language because artificial languages
      can be designed to be less ambiguous.  (Also easier for the
      computer to follow.)

Exercise
--------

_Practice writing algorithms!_

* Form a group with other people with the same card.
* Write instructions so that Sam can make a wow butter and fruit spread 
  sandwich using the bag o' sandwich supplies.
    * Limit the damage to the room and Sam.
    * Limit the mess in the room.
    * Assume that Sam is clueless.
     
Debrief
-------

_Probably not until Monday._
