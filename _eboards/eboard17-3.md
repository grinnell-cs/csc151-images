Administrative stuff
--------------------

### Introductory notes

* Happy March!
* Happy Week Seven!
* Ramadan Mubarak.
* I realize many of you are feeling (and being) attacked by our governments,
  including both federal and state. Please remember that there are still
  many people who care deeply about you (including me).
* Sorry that I was gone for so long. The conference was a success. But I'm
  exhuasted.
* To make matters worse, my email is acting up.
* But I brought you Octocat stickers!

Less positive things

* Mid-semester reports are due today. Some of you will be hearing from 
  Academic Advising. You may also see Academic Alerts.
* I'm also turning in Academic Alerts for those of you who did not turn
  in MP4.
* My substitutes were surprised to see that so many of you didn't feel
  compelled to be here on time.

MP5
---

* Goal: Make abstract art by combining variants of images (simple shapes).
* Primary objective: Practice with lists (and nested lists) and the procedures
  that manipulate lists, particularly `map` and `apply` or `reduce`.
* Basic idea: We can think of many basic shapes as having three
  primary attributes: width, height, and color.
    * We can transform those attributes to make variants.
    * We can ignore the shape type and think of them as parameters to
      another function.
* Part one: Make lists of variants of the key attributes.
* Part two: Turn lists of shapes into lists of other shapes.
* Part three: Combine those lists of shapes.
* Part four: Freestyle.

```
;;; (shape-params shape) -> list?
;;;   shape : basic-image?
;;; Create a list of the width, height, and color of the image.
(define shape-params
  (lambda (img)
    (list (image-width img) (image-height img) (image-color img))))

;;; (something umyeah) -> image?
;;;   umyeah : image?
;;; Get a solid isosceles triangle the same width, height, and color
;;; as `umyeah`.
(define something 
  (o (cut (apply solid-isosceles-triangle <>)) 
     shape-params))
```

Questions
---------

### Administrative

### Scheme

### Readings

### MP5

What should we do for the freestyle?

> Some "interesting" grid-like collection of shapes. Probably abstract.

> No more sophisticated than what's in the reading (like the grid o'
  triangles.)

### Other

Difficult issues
----------------

_I realize that many other issues will interfere with your ability to
discuss these issues deeply. Nonetheless, I'd like to consider them a
bit, particularly since our second SoLA is immediately after spring break._

### Issue 1: Take-home exams

_You already have the background for this one._

Quick closed-eye survey: What kind of exams would you prefer?

* In-class, no computer (like quizzes). [0]
* In-class, with computer. [1]
* Take-home (like SoLA 1). [12]

TPS: How should I address issues of inappropriate collaboration and
potential ChatGPT/Generative AI use?

* Add individual monitors to students.
* Make the expectations clear and report instances.

### Issue 2: Struggling students

_Background: A higher percentage of students are struggling in CSC-151
than I've ever seen. And, believe it or not, I've cut back on the work
in the MPs. But there are also students who are doing fine, including
students who haven't programmed before. What should I do?_

Pace of class

* Too fast [5]
* About right [7]
* Too slow [1]

What approaches are there that might help?

* Shift deadlines from Thursday to Sunday. (Other shifts, too.)
* Find better support for weekend work.
* More hints on MPs. (Ask more questions!)
* A third mentor session for mini-project support.
