Administrative stuff
--------------------

### Introductory notes

* Happy March!
* Happy Week Seven!
* Ramadan Mubarak.
* I realize many of you are feeling (and being) attacked by our governments,
  including both federal and state. Please remember that there are still
  many people who care deeply about you (including me).
* Sorry that I was gone for so long. The conference was a success. But I'm
  exhuasted.
* To make matters worse, my email is acting up.
* But I brought you Octocat stickers!

Less positive things

* Mid-semester reports are due today. Some of you will be hearing from 
  Academic Advising. You may also see Academic Alerts.
* I'm also turning in Academic Alerts for those of you who did not turn
  in MP4.
* My substitutes were surprised to see that so many of you didn't feel
  compelled to be here on time.

MP5

* Goal: Make abstract art by combining variants of images (simple shapes).
* Primary objective: Practice with lists (and nested lists) and the procedures
  that manipulate lists, particularly `map` and `apply` or `reduce`.
* Basic idea: We can think of many basic shapes as having threee
  primary attributes: width, height, and color.
    * We can transform those attributes to make variants.
    * We can ignore the shape type and think of them as parameters to
      another function.
* Part one: Make lists of variants of the key attributes.
* Part two: Turn lists of objects into lists of other objects.
* Part three: Combine those lists of objects.
* Part four: Freestyle.

```
;;; (shape-params shape) -> list?
;;;   shape : basic-image?
;;; Create a list of the width, height, and color of the image.
(define shape-params
  (lambda (img)
    (list (image-width img) (image-height img) (image-color img))))

;;; (something img) -> solid-isosceles-triangle?
;;;   img : image?
;;; Create a solid isosceles triangle of the same width, height, and
;;; color as `img`.
(define something 
  (o (cut (apply solid-isosceles-triangle <>)) 
     shape-params))
```

Difficult issues
----------------

_I realize that many other issues will interfere with your ability to
discuss these issues deeply. Nonetheless, I'd like to consider them a
bit, particularly since our second SoLA is immediately after spring break._

### Issue 1: Take-home exams

_You already have the background for this one._

Quick closed-eye survey: What kind of exams would you prefer?

* In-class, no computer (like quizzes). 
* In-class, with computer. 
* Take-home (like SoLA 1).

TPS: How should I address issues of inappropriate collaboration and
potential ChatGPT/Generative AI use?

* Make sure to limit options to the code we use and report people who use
  other code.
* Accept that there are coincidences.
* Unfortunately, College policies do not allow "chat with students about it".
* Unfortunately, College policies do not allow "I think you used ChatGPT,
  you get a zero"
* In both cases, I need to report to CAS.
* Students need to understand that it's important to behave appropriately.
* Maybe "Explain the code you wrote."
* Maybe "Support your answers with relevant citations."
* Reduce incentive to cheat.

### Issue 2: Struggling students

_Background: A higher percentage of students are struggling in CSC-151
than I've ever seen. And, believe it or not, I've cut back on the work
in the MPs. But there are also students who are doing fine, including
students who haven't programmed before. What should I do?_

* The ability to redo means that some of us are de-prioritizing the first
  submission (we're planning on redos).
* Use spring break (as not a break).
* Finding the relevant readings is hard. (Think about a "guidance" page.)
* Thursday deadline for submissions is hard. (Move to Sunday?) (But
  lots of work is due on Sundays.) (Every time is hard.) Move late
  deadline to Sunday. A little overlap is okay.
