Administrative stuff
--------------------

### Introductory notes

* Welcome to our visitor!
* A fascinating email: "Dear Sam, I'm prioritizing a homework assignment 
  in another class over showing up for CSC-151. But I'd like to take the
  quiz. So I'm going to show up for another section's quiz time."
* MP6 is now graded. Our graders are rapidly finishing redos of MP4 and 
  MP5. I'm going to leave the due dates for the redos as they are, but
  set up a free late redo.

A few notes from last class
---------------------------

* Key idea: We want to abstract away from the underlying representation 
  of the data. If we access data in a compound object only through 
  procedures, it doesn't/shouldn't matter how it's actually implement.
* Implication: When we're dealing with a collection of data, we should
  think about how to abstract away our own representations, using only
  the procedures we design.
* Side note: Often, we'll be called upon to implement someone else's
  not-necessarily clear policies.

Questions
---------

### Administrative

### Readings

Is it possible to change the mutability of structs like you can
with vectors or hash tables?

> Yes, we can make mutable structs. By default, structs are immutable,
  but you can add `#:mutable` to either the struct as a whole or
  individual fields to make them mutable. Check out the [Racket Guide
  on Structs](https://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/define-struct.html)
  for details.

How do we know what we can put in a structure? (i.e. year, month, date)

> Documentation!

Can you explain what the difference between a husk and a kernel is?

> You've noted we often have implicit restrictions on our procedures
  (e.g., input types, limits on input values). Ideally, we should
  "fail clearly" on bad inputs. But that means taking the effort to
  check for bad inputs. The husk protects the kernel by checking
  inputs; the kernel does the main work and assumes that it has
  correctly inputs.

Could you give a broad overview of why this reading is important?

> We learned on Monday that it's good to separate what we do with
  data from how we represent it. Structs give us a programmatic way
  to do so.

> Also: Structs automatically build a bunch of procedures for you.

Where do `date-kernel-year`, `date-kernel-month`, and `date-kernel-day`
come from?

> They are generated automatically from
  `(struct date-kernel (year month day))`.
