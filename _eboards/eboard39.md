Questions
---------

### Administrative

Can I take an incomplete in this class?

> Although I would prefer that every student finish by the end of finals
  week, I permit incompletes according to both College and class guidelines.

> College guidelines suggest that incompletes are appropriate if you have
  _one_ outstanding assignment. In our case, that's a mini-project.

> There may be special circumstances that would indicate that you should
  be permitted to take an incomplete with more than one outstanding
  mini-project. You'll need to discuss those with me in advance.

> Incompletes do not permit you to make up LAs (or anything other than 
  mini-projects).

What should I do if I emailed Sam a late assignment/redo and he forgot
to upload it?

> Ask him again (and again) (and again)

### Trees

How do you do a family tree with computer trees?

> Um, it doesn't work well.

What should we do if there's only one child?

> We can have either the left child or the right child be null/empty.
  Sometimes, the leftness/rightness of a child has meaning.

### Project

What should I do if GradeScope won't let me upload the project files?

> Email them to me.
