### MP9

### Misc

Work time
---------

Come grab Maddy or Sam if you want help. Otherwise, we'll do our best to
stay out of your way.

How can we use recursion?

> You will likely want to use recursion when dealing with neighboring
  pixels or positions.

> In some circumstances, you might achieve blurs or other effects through
  recursion. (Repeatedly shrinking a pixel-based image and then enlarging
  it could cause blurring.)

Do we have to generate something identical to the original image?

> No. But it would be nice if you got close.
