Administrivia
-------------

* Grades were distributed around noon on Tuesday. I have not yet updated
  tokens.
* Reminder: I have no scheduled office hours during Finals Week. I will 
  be in my office as much as I can. Feel free to DM me to check if I'm 
  there or to ask questions.
* For some reason, some of you never did the Ethics LA. I've reopened that.
  (It will be listed as late, but there's no penalty.)
* I expect to see all of you here on Friday.
* If you plan to request an incomplete, note that those are due on 
  Friday. As I mentioned earlier, those should be for just one mini-project.
* Since we'll be filling out EOCEs in class on Friday and we have fewer
  computers than people, it would be nice if some of you brought laptops
  on Friday.
