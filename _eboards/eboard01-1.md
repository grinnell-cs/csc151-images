_Approximate overview_

* Lots of administrative stuff, including attendance
* What is "computer science"?
* A group activity, more or less
* Debrief on activity (possibly continued on Friday)

Administrative stuff
--------------------

**Warning! You are being recorded** (and transcribed) (provided the technology
is working correctly).

_Please take a playing card, if you didn't already._

_You may also wish to take a mask._

### Introductory Notes

* Hi, I'm Sam (or SamR).
* Our class mentor is Sarah Deschamps
    * Sarah will introduce herself
* The class Web site is at 
  <https://rebelsky.cs.grinnell.edu/Courses/CSC151/2025Sp/>.
    * I will email you the link.
    * The class Web site is (always) a work in progress. 
* CSC-151 is *an introductory course in computer science*.
    * You can succeed (and even excel) with no prior experience.
    * We approach material differently than many other intro courses;
      prior experience may help, but it may also hinder.  For example,
      we will not let you re-assign variables.  (Don't worry if you
      don't know what that means.)
* CSC-151 is *a community*.  We come from multiple cultures and backgrounds.
  Treat each other with respect and appreciate what each person can contribute.
    * We will return to this issue and the associated learning outcomes
      throughout the semester.
* I type our online class notes in a format called "markdown".  You should
  find it relatively readable.  It permits me to make "nice" Web pages.
    * Isn't this beautiful?
    * Sam: Don't forget to show off today's eboard.
    * **Don't just rely on my notes**; There is good evidence that taking 
      your own notes helps you learn.
* I will record our class sessions (audio, mediocre transcript, and
  pointless video) using Teams and Otter.ai. You will be able to find the
  recordings on Teams.
* I sent email to all students who were enrolled as of 10:00 a.m. on Tuesday.
  Please let me know if you did not receive that email.
    * Please let me know if you have trouble accessing Gradescope.
    * Please let me know if you have trouble accessing our class Team.

### Other introductory stuff

* We provide supplies in this classroom to support you in working
  and learning.
    * Small cards to serve as flashcards, which are a good learning technique.
    * Also large post-it pads that are gridded.
    * And pens.
    * And masks.
* On that note ... a friendly reminder that Grinnellians are returning
  from around the world and brining viruses and bacteria back with them.
* I prefer to have you book office hours. First priority in any time
  slot goes to those who book. <https:/bit.ly/book-samr>
    * Office hours are not yet available.
* You can also DM me on Teams to arrange office hours (or email me, or
  talk to me after class).
* You'll learn more introductory stuff when you read the syllabus.

### Apologies

* I am old.  My hearing is not great, even with hearing aids.
* Our Web site is not as up to date as I'd like.  But it will be.
* I am traditionally bad at names+faces.  I will be worse with masks.  It
  will take me some time to learn your names.
* I experienced a significant loss in the fall and am still not back to
  normal. I expect to be less on top of things than I'd like.
* More to come ....

### Upcoming activities

### Excited About

### Q&A

What is computer science?
-------------------------

* Computer science is the study of *algorithms* and *data structures*
    * Algorithms: Sets of (unambiguous) instructions.
    * Data Structures: Ways to organize information.
* We study algorithms by  ...
    * writing algorithms to accomplish certain tasks.  
      (E.g., Organizing or searching information.)
        * identify problems
        * generalize / simplify 
        * write instructions that allow "you" to solve them
    * analyzing their efficacy.
    * writing systems that implement those instructions (e.g., hardware 
      or languages).
    * considering their effects on individuals or society.
* We study data structures in similar ways.
* Most of this class will be writing and thinking about sets of
  instructions in an artificial language (aka a programming language).
    * We use an artificial language because artificial languages
      can be designed to be less ambiguous.  (Also easier for the
      computer to follow.)

Exercise
--------

_Practice writing algorithms!_

* Form a group with other people with the same card.
* Write instructions so that Sam can make a ??? and ??? sandwich
  using the box o' sandwich supplies.
    * Assume that Sam is clueless.
