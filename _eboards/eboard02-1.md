Administrative stuff
--------------------

### Introductory notes

* Something that didn't end up in the syllabus and should have: I'm
  not only bad at remembering names, I'm likely to swap them. (There's
  a longer statement that's now in the syllabus.) I apologize.
* I should also report that I believe that all teaching is performative.
* I make it a practice to call on students using a set of cards with
  names on it.
    * I use this process to give you practice "thinking on your feet",
      as it were.
    * I also use this process to help everyone realize that they are
      not the only one who is puzzled.
    * And I use the process to push you a bit.
    * Feel free to say "I'm not sure" or "I'd prefer not to answer."
    * If you don't want to be called on in class, please let me know.
* The `csc151` library (which you'll learn about in lab today) is
  updated regularly. Each time you sit down to work, you should try to 
  update the version you have. The lab will tell you how.
    * Also: Let me know when you encounter bugs or unexpected behavior.
* Reminder to self: Vygotsky's zone of proximal development.
* Consider setting up password reset on <https://passwordreset.grinnell.edu>.

### Friday PSA


## Q&A

### Administrative

**How do I record tokens?**

> On the ["Tokens earned" assignment on Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/948769/assignments/5651903).

### MathLAN

**How do I run Linux on my computer?**

> You shouldn't need to run Linux on your computer.

> You can run DrRacket on your computer. (Instructions are in the
  [syllabus](../syllabus)).

> You can also log into MathLAN remotely, but it's a bit complicated.
