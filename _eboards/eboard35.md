About the project
-----------------

Group project (size 1--4).  We'll talk about group formation last. 

Liberal arts project.  Use your programming and image-making skills
to help you better understand art.

Pick a starting image or set of images by Hilma Af Klint.

Write a procedure, `(image-series n width height)`, that makes a
`width`-by-`height` image.  It should make a different image for each
`n` between 0 and 999, inclusive.  They should all be similar and
related to the original.

Use at least two of the three key image-design techniques: shapes,
positional computation, neighbor computation.

Use recursion at least twice.

See [the instructions](../mps/mp09) for more details.
