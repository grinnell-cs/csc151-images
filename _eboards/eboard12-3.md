Administrative stuff
--------------------

### Introductory notes

* I am out of Otter.ai minutes, so there is no Otter transcription/summary
  for any classes today.
* In case you hadn't figured it out yet, you have an hour to complete an
  LA from the time that you start the LA, even if you close your computer
  or log out of Gradescope.
* Remember that you can take both/all quizzes. And you can stay until
  thirty minutes after the end of class to complete them.

Q&A
---

### Administrative

When will we get grades on today's quizzes?

> Sam hopes to have those done tonight.

What should we submit for redos?

> The updated `.rkt` file.

> Any images required by the assignment.

> A text (preferably) or PDF file name `CHANGES.txt` (or `CHANGES.pdf`)
  that summarizes what problems you had the first time and what changes
  you've made. It can also be `CHANGES.rkt`.

I accidentally opened an LA early because I didn't understand the
timing. Can you help me?

> Yes, I can reset them if you DM me.

### Booleans and conditionals

Why does the equality predicate `=` not also count as a comparator?

> Comparators are supposed to tell you whether one thing comes before 
  another. `=` does not.

Could you go over the `not` procedure and its uses?

> `(not expression)` -> Gives the "opposite" result of the expression.

```racket
;;; (anything-but-string? val) -> boolean?
;;;   val : any?
;;; Returns false if `val` is a string and true otherwise.
(define anything-but-string?
  (lambda (val)
    (not (string? val))))
```

I read and reread the truish breakdown and was still confused. What
are examples of statements that would result in a truish output?
What would produce not false, but then not be true?

> `(not #f)` is always true, `#t`.

> However, there are values that are neither `#f` nor `#t`. For example,
  `"hello"` or the result of `(+ 2 3)`. We consider those "truish". If
  we use them as the test/guard in a conditional, instead of an error,
  we'll see them treated as if they were true.

What do we need to understand when making the distinction between
keywords and procedures?

> You should understand that the order of evaluation is different
  (and, preferably, what that order is).

> Normal (e.g., `(+ exp1 exp2 exp3)`, `exp1` is `(* 3 4)`): Evaluate
  each expression from left to right and then add them. (In general,
  evaluate from left to right and then apply the procedure.)

> Lambda (i.e., `(lambda (params) exp)`): When we apply one of these,
  we substitute the arguments for the corresponding parameters in the
  expression and then evaluate the updated expression. What about
  just the lambda? It builds a procedure, but does NOT evaluate the expression
  until later. (It also doesn't evaluate the params.)

> If (i.e., `(if test consequent alternate)`): Evaluate the `test`. If
  it's true, evaluate the consequent and return its value. If the test
  evaluated to false, evaluate the alternate and return its value.

> And (i.e., `(and exp1 exp2 exp3)`): Evaluates the expressions one by
  one. If any of them are false, immediately returns false and does not
  evaluate the remaining expressions. If none of them are false (it has
  evaluated all of them), return the value of the last expression.
  `(and (string? s1) (string? s2) (string-append s1 s2))`.

> Or (ie.., `(or exp1 exp2 exp3)`): Evaluates the expressions one at a
  time. If any of them are truish, returns that value. If all of them
  are false, returns false.
