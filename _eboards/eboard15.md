Questions
---------

### Administrative

When will I have a chance to make up the conditionals quiz?

> On the next SoLA. 

> In general, if you miss quiz LAs or SoLA LAs, you make them up on the
  next SoLA. There are a few exceptions.

What's the style quiz going to be like?

> This is generally not a good question to ask at 10pm the night
  before the quiz.

> The [LAs page](../las) has sample problems for most LAs.
