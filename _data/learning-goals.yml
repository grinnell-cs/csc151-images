- assessment: Learning Assessments, Phase 1 (LAP 1)
  goals:
    - "**Decomposition**. Decompose a computational problem into smaller sub-problems amendable to implementation with procedures."
    - "**Procedural abstraction**. Take a concrete implementation in Racket and create a procedure that generalizes that behavior."
    - "**Tracing**. Trace the execution of a Racket program using a substitutive model of computation.  _This LA may only be completed in class._"
    - "**Primitive types**. Express basic computations over primitive values and their associated standard library functions."
    - "**Conditionals**. Use Boolean expressions and conditional operations to produce conditional behavior."
    - "**Collaboration**. Explain best practices for solving problems in a collaborative setting."

- assessment: Learning Assessments, Phase 2 (LAP 2)
  goals:
    - "**Documentation**. Document programs according to good software engineering principles."
    - "**Testing**. Test programs according to good software engineering principles."
    - "**Program style**. Write and structure code in ways that make it easier to understand."
    - "**Lists**. Manipulate lists with fundamental higher-order list functions."
    - "**Lambda-free anonymous procedures**. Use `cut` and composition to simplify computations."
    - "**Ethical considerations**.  Consider implications of the power of computing."

- assessment: Learning Assessments, Phase 3 (LAP 3)
  goals:
    - "**List recursion**.  Design and write recursive functions over lists."
    - "**Local bindings**. Refactor redundancy and add clarity in computations with let-bindings."
    - "**Numeric recursion**.  Design and write recursive functions over the natural numbers."
    - "**Vectors**.  Design and write functions (potentially recursive functions) that use vectors."
    - "**Diagramming structures**.  Use our mental model of memory to describe or diagram the layout of memory for lists, pairs, and vectors/arrays. _This LA may only be completed in class._"
    - "**Randomness**.  Write programs that produce predictably unpredictable output."

- assessment: Learning Assessments, Phase 4 (LAP 4)
  goals:
    - "**Dictionaries**.  Design and write functions that use dictionaries."
    - "**Data abstraction**.  Design data structures to separate interface from implementation."
    - "**Higher-order programming**.  Write procedures that take procedures as parameters and return procedures as results."
    - "**Tree recursion**.  Design and write recursive functions over trees."
    - "**Running time**.  Use a mental model of computation to count the relevant number of operations performed by a function."
    - "**Sorting and searching**.  Update or modify fundamental sorting and searching algorithms or trace the execution of those algorithms over concrete inputs."
