        bio: This is my second year teaching at Grinnell and my second time teaching CSC 151. I grew up in Ohio, and studied computer ccience at Colby College in Maine. The first time I ever took a CS class was my second semester of college. After graduation, I moved to Seattle, Washington where I worked at software companies Amazon and EnergySavvy for three years, then earned my PhD from the University of Washington. My PhD dissertation is about student sense of belonging in college computer science. When I'm not teaching, I enjoy indoor climbing, gravel biking, and spending time with my husband John and cat Mocha.

        bio: Hello! My name is Jake, I am a second-year student, and I intend on majoring in Computer Science.

When I took 151 last year, it was my first time ever coding in my life! If I can do it, you can surely do it to! I love to help so don't be afraid to reach out to me!
