About the professor (i.e., about SamR)
--------------------------------------

_How did you get into computer science?_

> I entered college planning to be a math major (and I even graduated
college as a math major).  But I quickly learned that I would never be
a great math major.  More importantly, when I took my first computer
science class (in Lisp, if I recall correctly), I found that CS had
everything I liked about math (particularly problem solving) along with
the ability to construct things and to see your solutions "in action"
as it were.  I've never looked back.

> Over the past few years, I've started making art (mostly 
non-representational, sometimes with a performative aspect).  I find
art-making and programming have many similarities, including the great
positive of making something new and interesting.

_Pick a category of objects and list five of your favorite objects in 
that category._

> Favorite ways to spend time.  1. Doing almost anything with my
wife and kids - just hanging, playing games, discussing some silly
topic, whatever.  2. Reading (usually science fiction or nonfiction,
but I have eclectic tastes).  3. Coding (yeah, I code for fun).  4.
Playing board games.  5.  Organizing things (books, CDs, whatever),
even though you can't tell that by looking at my office.

> I regret that "exercise" doesn't fall in that top 5.  I'm working on it.

_What are your favorite board games?_

> Mostly ones that few people have heard of (well, two of these board
gamers know, but not many other people): Cosmic Encounter. Yacht
Race, Carcasonne, and Circus Maximus.  But I play a lot of different
games.  My eldest would like us to play more Canasta.  I'd like to
play more games, but there's rarely time.

_What is your favorite programming language? It may be easy to deny, but most people have a preference._

> Believe it or not, but it depends on the task.

> I really love programming in C.  It's efficient, it requires understanding of the machine, and it's concise.  I love C enough that I teach a one-credit course to get CS students to think more like C programmers.

> I love programming in Scheme about as much.  I don't think I've ever seen beautiful C code, but I can say that some Scheme code that one could really call beautiful.  (Okay, I think lots of map-reduce is beautiful.)  I also play around a lot with various aspects of the class code.

> But when I need a quick text manipulation program, I hack it out in Perl.  My children tell me that I should use Python instead.

> I'm starting to find that I enjoy programming in Javascript, too, although
I need a better environment for doing so.  Javascript gives me many of the
things I like about Scheme (other than a nice syntax) with some additional
capabilities.

_Why did you become a computer science professor?_

> I started studying CS because I found it really compelling - I like 
making things and I like formal problem solving.  I became a professor
because I discovered I love seeing students learn and feeling like I
had a part in that learning.  I also seemed to some talent at teaching.

_What made you want to teach?_

> My mother was also a college professor.  (You can see her outstanding
psychology teacher of the year award inside my office door.)  Although
I was impressed by the effect she had on her students, I didn't think
I'd become a professor.  But in college and grad school, I learned that
I really liked teaching and seemed to be relatively good at it.  And
there are few feelings as good as seeing a student understand a complex
concept and knowing you had a role in that understanding.  Plus teaching
is a really interesting and complex challenge.

_What made you want to teach at Grinnell?_

> When I finished my Ph.D., I looked for places that cared about
teaching but that would let me continue research.  I ended up taking a
non-tenure-track job at Dartmouth for a few years, but really wanted to
be on the tenure track.  At the time I applied, I visited lots of places.
Grinnell was clearly the best fit - faculty who cared about teaching
and who were willing to innovate, students who were engaged.  And I
was clearly a good fit for Grinnell as I got an offer really quickly
after the visit.  It's been a great place to be - I continue to love the
students, value the colleagues, and find myself challenged and encouraged.

_Have you ever published any software?_

> It depends on how you define "published".  The CSC 151 software has been
distributed to lots of people.  A Web service I wrote, oh, two decades
ago, got used pretty heavily for about five years.  But almost everything
I do is open source.  My latest software is published on the Web.

_What would you do differently if you could do college again?_

> Let's see.  1. I'd learn good work habits.  2. I'd work on my writing.
3. I'd do internships.

> 1.  Work habits.  I was able to get reasonably good grades in college
by relying on my intellect, not on hard work.  So when I got to grad
school, I was screwed.  Developing good work habits earlier would have
made the rest of my life better.

> 2. Writing.  I did really well on writing when I was in high school
(and even in a few college courses I took in HS).  But my writing was
not great.  Not focused.  Too much passive voice.  Etc.  I took a writing
course my first year of grad school and it made me a much better writer.
I wish I had done that earlier.

> 3. Internships.  I love what I do.  But I really never explored anything
outside academia.  I should have.

_What's the one food item you can't live without?_

> I want to say chocolate, but I think "fruit" is probably the answer if
you'll accept that.  If I have too narrow, I think it's pears.  Of course,
to be literal, I think it's water (although water isn't food).

_What is your favorite section of computer science?_

> My favorite courses to teach: CSC 151, because I like introducing
students to the field. CSC 207, because I think it's where you
really start to develop the tools of computer scientist and software
designer.  CSC 282, my one-credit "C & Unix" seminar, because I can
make sure you learn things that are essential. (Whoops, that's
three; I can't choose a favorite.)  Oh, I also like teaching tutorial.

_I hear rumors that you are attempting to write an essay each day. 
Is that really the case?_

> It was.  For about three years, beginning in Fall 2016, I wrote
an essay on some topic nearly every day.  But it was overwhelming.
These days, I write about
one each week.  You can find them all at
<https://rebelsky.cs.grinnell.edu/musings>.  If you want to
"subscribe", follow me on Twitter or use [the RSS
feed](https://rebelsky.cs.grinnell.edu/musings/rss).

> Writing is great.  It helps you learn.  Well, it helps me learn.
And it can be fun to think about how to structure sentences and
thoughts.  (I need to work more on that.)
