# {{ page.title }}

Tokens are one way to approach they many issues that life springs upon you throughout the semester.  They provide a uniform way to handle the things that typically come up in a course, such as late submissions or unexcused absences.

You begin the course with **3 tokens**, and you may 

+ _**Late reading**_: Use **1 token** to turn in any reading problem up to 48 hours late.
+ _**Late lab writeup**_: Use **1 token** to turn in any lab writeup problem up to 48 hours late.
+ _**Late mini-project**_: Use **1 token** to turn in a mini-project up to 48 hours late.
+ _**Incomplete mini-project**_: Use **1 token** to turn in the first redo of a mini-project for which you received an I.  (Mini-projects that receive an R or an M the first time through get a free redo.)
+ _**Late redo**_: Use **1 token** to turn in a redo of a mini-project up to 48 hours late.
+ _**Second redo**_: Use **2 tokens** for a second redo on any project.
+ _**Late to class**_:  Use **1 token** to show up to class late (after we take attendance).
+ _**Unexcused absence**_: Use **2 tokens** to miss class without reasonable notification.

In general, you may not redo reading problems or lab writeups.  It is important to your learning that you do those in a timely manner.

In most cases, we will charge tokens automatically by noting the time of your submission on Gradescope.  You can check your current token status on Gradescope.

## Earning tokens

In general, you can earn additional tokens on top of your initial three in one of three ways:

+ You can attend one of the regular CS department events, such as CS table (lunchtime convesations) or CS extras (talks).
+ You can attend certain other designated campus events, such as Scholars' Convocation.
+ You can support your classmates by attending their performances or competitions.

Token-bearing events will be announced in class.

To earn tokens by attending events, attend the event and then submit a one-paragraph reflection **within 72 hours** of the event on Gradescope.  

Note that a reflection is not the same as a description.  I'm interested in hearing, for example, what you took away from the event or surprising things you observed.

See the information below on how to submit reflections.

At times, I may also offer tokens for other things, such as all of the class completing a survey.

## Submitting reflections

You will submit your reflection to the **Tokens** assignment on gradescope, but this requires some special instructions.  These instructions are forthcoming.

## Overspending tokens

At the end of the semester, if you have used more tokens than you possess, those extra "negative tokens" will count against your final grade.

+ Overspending of 1--5 tokens will drop your grade by one-third of a letter grade, _e.g._, from a B+ to a B.
+ Overspending of 6--10 tokens will drop your grade by a two-thirds of a letter grade, _e.g._, from a B+ to a B-.
+ Overspending of 11--15 tokens will drop your grade by a full letter grade, _e.g._, from a B+ to a C+.

And so on for every 5 overspent tokens.

Remember that you are allowed to gather excess tokens during the semester to use at later times or allow your tokens to go negative if you replace them before the end of the semester. Tokens will only affect your final grade if, at the end of the semester, you have negative tokens.
