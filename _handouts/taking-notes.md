In my many years of teaching this course, I've seen many student
approaches to taking notes.  Some students have clearly developed
careful note-taking habits, and continue to use them in this course.
Others see that I write a lot on the eboards, and don't take any notes.
And some others are somewhere in between.  In this document, I suggest
some approaches to note-taking in CSC 151.

Some general principles
-----------------------

First, you should know that *there is good evidence that taking notes helps
you learn the material*.  Hence, even though there is a written record of
most of what I say in class, you should still take some notes on your own.
My written record is not intended to replace your notes.  Rather, it is
intended to be a supplement so that you don't feel that you have to write
down everything.

Second, you should know that *the best learning happens when you reflect
on the most important points, and take notes on those*.  It is, of course,
sometimes difficult to identify the most important points, particularly
when lots of ideas are being raised during class.  I recommend that you
review materials (the reading, the lab, your quick notes, and my 
notes/eboards) after class, and see if you can pick out a few most important
points, which you then record.  You might, for example, record details
of some of the more complex procedures you wrote.

Third, you need to consider how to *organize your notes for efficient
access*.  While taking notes will help you remember things, at some point
you will need to look things up.  How can you organize your material to
make that easier?

Particular issues for CSC 151
-----------------------------

As Stephen Bloch of Adelphi University notes, introductory computer science
expects that you will need to master a wide variety of levels of knowledge 
in order to succeed in the class.

* You will need to learn a new language.  (In our case, the language is Scheme.)
  That means that you have to learn grammar, vocabulary, and even style.
* You will need to learn the ways to write in the language.  Instead of
  using a program that you are familiar with, like Microsoft Word, you
  will learn a new environment (Linux and DrRacket).
* Neither the language nor the environment are the primary learning goal
  of the course.  Rather, we want to help you think carefully about how you
  write algorithms, formalized sets of instructions.  And we also want you
  to learn some common algorithms.
* And we want you to follow good practices for writing algorithms.

My maladaption of Bloch's example goes as follows: This course is a bit
like one in which you have to write a fifteen-page paper on Napoloeon's
invasion of Russia (new domain knowledge), focusing on the economic
impacts of that invasion (using a new disciplinary lens), in Icelandic (in
a language that you don't currently know), in a manner appropriate for
publication in a literary magazine (incorporating stylistic issues in this
language that you don't know), using a quill pen (with a technology that
is not normally one that you use).  

What does that mean for note taking?  It means that you have to pay attention
to the different levels of what you are learning.  At times, you are learning
basic technical skills.  At others, you are learning a language and
some vocabulary in that language.  At others, you are learning how to write
well in that language.  At others, you are learning a new way of thinking.  
And so on and so forth.  I'll try to point out some of the particular levels
of thinking, but I won't always do so.

Multiple modes of note taking
-----------------------------

As suggested above, I recommend that you *take notes during class*.  You
may just want to scribble down a few high points (or low points).  But you
should record enough that you can look at your notes to start to recall
what happened.

I also recommend that you *regularly create summaries*.  A summary
will draw upon your notes, my notes, your answers to labs or homework
assignments, and so on and so forth.  At times, I may incentivize summaries,
such as by allowing you to bring a page of summary notes to a quiz or test.

Many students find it useful to *take notes while reading*.  I will admit
that I have never been good at marking up the texts I read, even though I
do "read actively".  But I see many very successful students printing out
readings and taking notes as they go.  In CSC 151, it's also helpful to
*try code while reading*.  Most of our readings introduce new ways of
expressing ideas in code.  You understand the code much better when you
try it (and then take notes on what you observe).  Taking notes on readings
also allows you to *develop questions* that you can ask in class.

Because you are learning a new language, you might follow some of
the strategies that people commonly use for studying languages.
In particular, I suggest that you *take notes on flash cards*.  I will
provide you with a variety of colors of flash cards; you can decide
how to use the colors.  For example, you might have one color (probably
white) for vocabulary, another for syntax, another for stylistic issues,
and so on and so forth.  One distinct advantage of flash cards is that
you can also rearrange them quickly.  That means that you can use your
flash cards to quickly look up vocabulary, as well as to quiz yourself
on that vocabulary.  

Final thoughts
--------------

Take notes.  Realize that there are different ways to take notes.  Explore
options, and see what works best for you.  But take notes.
