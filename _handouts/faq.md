This page represents my attempts to answer some questions that students
have asked (in the first assignment, in office hours, via email, etc.)

Note that there may be some repetition on this page.

About the course
----------------

_I see that the course is "Functional Problem Solving 'with lab'".  When
is the lab?_

> The lab is mixed in with the the regular course.  There is no separate
lab session.  However, you should know that this course meets three days
per week and you are expected to show up all three days.

_How difficult is the course?_

> That's a hard question to answer.  Computer science is a different
way of thinking.  Some folks find it natural.  Some folks find it nearly
impossible.  I see at least a factor of ten difference in the amount of
time students take on some assignments (e.g., some students can complete
an assignment in two hours, others will struggle to complete the
same assignment in twenty hours).  I've found no good ways to predict
how difficult someone will find the course.  I'm not alone in these
experiences; faculty nationwide observe the same tenfold difference.

> Of course, time spent is only one issue.  Often, the people who seem
to need to spend more time understand the material at least as well as
people who spend less time.

_How can I excel in the course?_

> Different students find different ways to excel.  In general, one 
excels in my courses by taking an active approach to the material -
read carefully, make lists of questions, ask questions in class, 
answer my questions, seek help when confused, discuss material with
colleagues, and so on and so forth.

> But I find students also excel when they engage enough with the
material that they find natural ways to exceed my expectations -
by finding new approaches, by doing creative things, by extending
ideas.

_I've heard that this is intended as a "weed out" course.  Is that
really the case?_ (2022-01-25)

> I've always tried to make CSC-151 a "fertilize" course; I love
CS and want to develop students' interterest in the field.  I'm
always happy when I convince a student to switch (potential) majors
to CS.

> But I don't make it an easy course.  My goal is to challenge you.

> And if it's supposed to be a weed-out course, it fails.  We have
lots and lots of students go on to CSC-161.

_I see that we're doing both exams (SoLAs) and quizzes outside of
class.  Does that mean they are open book?_ (2022-01-25)

> You may use DrRacket, the Course Web site, and the Racket
documentation for quizzes and exams.  You should not use other
people or the broader Internet.

_How do you enforce the limitation on what materials we use on
exams (SoLAs) and quizzes?_ (2022-01-25)

> I don't.  Believe it or not, I trust you to follow those
guidelines.

_Does the department have a course in which we learn to manage larger 
projects, with tens of thousands of lines of code?_ (2022-01-25)

> Traditionally, CSC-324, Software Design and Development, covers
those issues.  (You may not always end up with such a project, but
you discuss the mechanisms for doing so.)

_We are supposed to cite any peers we collaborate with on coursework.
For the citations, is it simply "I worked with this person" to
attribute credit to them, or is there a specific citation format
we are supposed to use?_ (2022-01-25)

> I prefer "I worked with _this person_ on _this part of the
assignment_."  Variants are certainly acceptable.  I care that
you cite, not that you cite in a particular format.

_How do we download DrRacket, the IDE we will use for this class?_
(2022-01-25)

> I generally prefer that you work in MathLAN, not least because
it means you can get help from evening tutors, random CS majors,
and each other.  But if you want DrRacket on your computer,
you can get it from <https://download.racket-lang.org>.

_How do quizzes count toward our grades?_ (2022-01-25)

> Quizzes will be individual learning assessments, so they count
toward the LA grades.
