# {{ page.title }}

We ask you to fill out a short reflection before and after each major
assignment ("mini project") and exam ("SoLA").  These surveys suggest the kinds
of questions that I think you should be asking yourself before and after each
major assignment and exam in any class you take.  They also help inform me of 
potential issues that I might address (e.g., if everyone takes too long on an
assignment, or everyone indicates potential confusion about a topic).  They may
evolve a bit as the semester progresses.

You can find the pre- and post-reflections on Gradescope.  Note that filling them out is _required_.

### Pre-MP reflection

Q1. Key concepts
  : What do you see as the key concepts that this assignment is asking you to learn or develop?

Q2 Challenges
  : What part of the assignment is likely to be the most difficult for you?  Why?

Q3 Brain dump
  : Without looking at any resources (e.g., readings, labs, your notes), write down everything you know that might be useful for this assignment.  (It's fine if you stop after three minutes; you might find it useful to spend more.)

Q4 Resources
  : What resources (e.g., individual procedures you've written, readings, labs) will be helpful as you work on this assignment?

Q5 Missing pieces
  : What open questions do you have?  What would you like to know in order to make this assignment easier to complete?  (Please don't answer "a solution".)

Q6 Time
  : How long do you expect this assignment to take?

### Post-MP refection

Q1: Successes
  : What went well on this assignment?

Q2: Challenges
  : What parts of the assignment were most difficult for you?  What made them difficult?

Q3: Addressing challenges
  : How can you address those kinds of challenges in the next assignment?  For example, would it help to start earlier?  To ask questions in advance?  To plan to space out the work over several days?  To gather different resources?

Q4: Time
  : How long did the assignment take?  Was that longer or shorter than you predicted?  What made the difference?

Q5: Pleasures
  : Which parts of the assignment, if any, did you find most enjoyable?

### Pre-SoLA reflection

Q1: Topic check
  : What are the topics (LAs) for this SoLA?

Q2: Accomplishments
  : Which of those have you already mastered (received credit for)?

Q3: Challenges
  : Which of these topics do you expect to find the most difficult?  Why?

Q4: Brain dump
  : Without looking at any resources (e.g., readings, labs, your notes), write down everything you know about each of the remaining topics.  (Please spend at least a minute or two on each topic, but feel free to spend more.)

Q5: Preparation
  : How will you prepare for the SoLA?  Some good strategies include doing sample problems, writing sample problems, attending mentor sessions, writing "cheat sheets" (that you don't actually cheat with), and spaced retrieval (spending a little bit of time each day preparing, rather than doing it all at once).
 
### Post-SoLA reflection

Q1: Attempts
  : How many LAs did you attempt on the SoLA?

Q2: Time
  : About how long did each take you?

Q3: Challenges
  : Which topics did you find the most difficult?  Why?

Q4: Successes
  : What preparation strategies seemed to have the greatest effect?  (I realize that this can be hard to tell.)

Q5: Changes
  : What will you do differently next time?  For example, will you prepare differently?  Will you try the LAs at a different time of day?  Spread them out throughout the day?
