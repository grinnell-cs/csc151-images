*This document describes my general approach to academic integrity.
I may modify the document for individual courses to better fit the
structure and style of those courses.  Please read this document
thoroughly and carefully so that neither you nor I have to deal
with instances of academic dishonesty.  Please also review the
Computer Science Department's policy on academic integrity, available
at <https://www.cs.grinnell.edu/academic-integrity>, as that
policy is in effect for this class.*

An important characteristic of the academic endeavor is the notion
that academics (students, faculty, researchers, staff) must follow high
standards of integrity in their academic work.  One component of academic
integrity is that academics must clearly indicate which work (ideas,
writing, etc.) is theirs and which belongs to others.

Grinnell's _Student Handbook_ includes the following statement.

> When you study at the College, you join a conversation among scholars,
professors, and students, one that helps sustain both the intellectual
community here and the larger world of thinkers, researchers, and
writers. The tests you take, the research you do, the writing you
submit - all these are ways you participate in this conversation.

> The College presumes that your work for any course is your own
contribution to that scholarly conversation, and it expects you to
take responsibility for that contribution.  That is, you should
acknowledge what is your own individual work and what you have derived
from others so that other members of the community can trace the
evolution of your ideas.

However, there is much more to academic honesty than just making sure to
cite work you've used.  In particular, you are expected to provide a true
and accurate representation of your work in experimental endeavors (e.g.,
it is academically dishonest to invent or modify experimental results).
It is also academically dishonest to aid another in an academically
dishonest act (e.g., to provide aid on a no-aid exam, to write a paper
for another student).

Why do we care so much about academic honesty?  As the *Student
Handbook* suggests, the advancement of knowledge requires
that a trail of ideas be available so that successes and failures can
be traced backward.  More importantly, your own personal integrity
should require you to be academically honest.

In Fall 2000, I had my first serious encounters with academic dishonesty
at Grinnell. Since that time, I have tried to be careful in spelling
out what I expect from my students.  What follows are some general
expectations.

*I expect you to follow the highest principles of academic
honesty.* Among other things, this means that any work you
turn in should be your own or should have the work of others clearly
documented.  However, when you explicitly work as part of a group or
team, you need not identify the work of each individual (unless I
specify otherwise).  You are, of course, required to make it clear
that you worked as part of a group or team, and who the members of
that group or team are.

*You should never "give away" answers to homework assignments or
examinations.*  You may, however, work together in developing an
approach for most homework assignments - design, general algorithms,
etc.  Except as specified on individual assignments, each student
should develop his, her, zir, or their own final version of the
assignment.  On most written assignments, each student should write
up an individual version of the assignment and cite the discussion.
On non-group programming assignments, each student should do his,
her, zir, or their own programming, although students may help each
other with design and debugging.  If someone else (e.g., a classmate or
class mentor) helps you on an assignment, please include a note in the
assignment that indicates that you received such help and summarizes
the help you received.

*When working on examinations, you should not directly use people
(other than me) as resources*.  For take-home examinations, I will
allow you to look up things on the Web, but you should read the
examination guidelines to be sure.  For in-class examinations, I will
expect you to rely primarily on yourself.  In most examinations, I
will not allow you to ask tutors and mentors anything pertaining
to the exam.  If you need help, you'll need to talk to me or one
of the other faculty members.

**If you have a question as to whether a particular action may violate
academic standards, please discuss it with me (preferably before you
undertake that action).**

Collaborative work
------------------

Most of my teaching involves *collaborative work*.
I believe (and have found) that students learn better when they
can consult with each other.  There are few better ways to learn
something than to explain that thing to someone else.  In computer
science, collaboration is particularly important because you often
encounter small problems that a second set of eyes can easily identify
and fix and because "real world" computer science is
almost always a collaborative activity.  For example, *pair
programming* is a key aspect of many forms of the software
design methodology known as agile programming.

In each assignment I give, I do my best to make it clear whether
the assignment is intended to be a group assignment or an individual
assignment. When it's an individual assignment, I do my best to indicate
whether parts of the assignment can be approached collaboratively.
If you're not sure, ask.

For most of my courses, most non-exam work will permit collaboration.
That is, if I don't specify otherwise on an individual assignment,
you may assume that you can talk about design together, should code
individually, and can help each other look for bugs (in design,
code, implementation, whatever).

Categories of work
------------------

In my classes, I assign a variety of types of work.  Different categories
have different expectations.

*Laboratories* are almost always collaborative.
You should generally plan to work on laboratories with at least one
other student.  When you're stuck on a problem, you should feel free to
ask for help from almost anyone (me, the class mentor, another student,
a TC, a friend, etc.), but include a note that you received such help.
If I ask you to write up a laboratory, you and your partner or partners
should do only one writeup.  You should not copy text from another
group's writeup.

*Homework assignments* and
*projects* may be individual or group assignments.  For either kind,
you should feel free to ask for help from almost anyone (me, the
class mentor, another student, a TC, a friend).  If I give an
individual homework, I expect each individual to write up his or
her answers individually (no copying!).  However, you may certainly
ask a colleague to proofread or comment on your answers, provided
you acknowledge that person.  If I give collaborative homework,
each group of students should write and turn in its own single set
of answers.  However, you can still ask colleagues in other groups
to proofread or comment on your answers.  (Once again, you should
acknowledge them.)

*Take-home examinations* are always individual work.  You may refer
to any written materials (e.g., textbooks, Web pages, your personal
notes) that you wish.  However, you may not talk to anyone (except
me or other faculty teaching the same course) about the examination
or related issues.  I'm very strict about this issue; I want you
to avoid *all* discussion about the exam, not just questions about
the material on the exam.  You certainly can't ask someone how to
do a problem.  But you can't ask about other things, either.  For
example, unless I grant explicit permission, you may not even ask a tutor
or mentor how to use the programming language for the exam.  Similarly,
you may not ask a colleague how much they've done on the exam or whether
they've finished a problem (and you can't brag about finishing a problem
either).  At times, I may give you permission to talk to the course mentor
about an exam, but please make sure that you have explicit permission.

*In-class quizzes and examinations* are also always individual work.
You may not talk during class or discuss the exam with anyone in
class.  You may ask me questions.  My in-class examinations are
typically closed-book and closed computer.  However, I typically
allow students to bring one sheet (8.5 x 11 inches) of hand-written
notes to the exam.

Citing program code
-------------------

Note that computer programming shares with normal writing a need to
cite work taken from elsewhere.  It is certainly acceptable practice
to borrow other code for your assignments.  However, you must cite any
code that you use from elsewhere, including your own code.  You are
also responsible for the quality of code you submit and you should
note that there's a lot of mediocre code on the Web.

*Each piece of code you take from elsewhere must include a
comment that points me to the original work*, even if you
modify the code after copying it.  Ideally, your comment would specify
all of the following:

* the author of the original code;
* the date the original code was written and the version of the
  code (if available);
* the date you incorporated the code into your program;
* a summary of the modifications (if any) you made to the code; and
* instructions for getting the original code (e.g., a URL).

These guidelines apply not only to the code you get from the Web and
elsewhere; they also apply to code you get from me and from the textbook.

As much as I appreciate a carefully constructed citation, *my
primary concern is that you clearly state that you have used the
work of another*.  Hence, I will also accept a short note
that simply gives the location from which you obtained code (e.g.,
you can just write "_These ideas_ and _this code_ taken from _this
URL_.")  

You need not cite the libraries you use, as the command to include
libraries within a program provides sufficient citation.

Citing Web pages
----------------

The advances of the Internet and the World Wide Web have led to
challenges in citation.  Some seem to believe that it is acceptable
for a citation to consist of a URL.  However, a citation should
provide much more information.  Consider what a typical citation to
the printed literature contains: Author, Date, Publisher, Title of
Article, Publisher, etc.  Your Web citations should contain at least as
much detail.  That is, you should include not just the URL, but also the
author of the page (using "Anonymous" or an institutional
author, if necessary), the title of the page, the publisher (the site),
and the date.

The date is particularly important.  Unlike printed sources, which
have new editions when they change, electronic resources often change
unexpectedly.  By including the date the page was accessed and modified,
you at least provide some indication of when the ideas you were using
were available at the specified location.

Here is a sample citation for my academic integrity policy, using a slight
variant of the APA format.

Once again, although I prefer careful citations, I will accept anything
that shows that you've made an appropriate effort to acknowledge any
work that your work draws upon.

Illustrative violations of academic integrity policies
------------------------------------------------------

Fortunately, there are few instances I've observed in which students
seem to violate principles and policies pertaining to academic
integrity.  But it does happen.  And sometimes it happens because
students are just careless.  I include a few examples to help you
avoid such carelessness.

On occasion, students turn in *output that does not match the code*.
Why wouldn't the output match the code?  In the worst case, it's
because the student could not get the code to work and simply
generated the output by hand (or copied it from examples in an assignment)
and hoped that I would not notice.  That's clearly an instance of forging
lab results, which is academically dishonest.  But there are other
reasons.  For example, it may be because students have created multiple
versions of the same program, and turn in the output from one version with
the code for another version.  While this behavior is unintentionally
dishonest, it is still deceptive and therefore dishonest.  And, once in
a while, a student may treat two parts of a problem as separate.  E.g.,
I might ask students to write a procedure that analyzes some data and
then to tell me the results of the analysis.  There have been instances
in which students could not write the procedure, did the analysis in
another way, and gave me the analysis without explaining what they did.
In some such instances, the Committee on Academic Standing has found
the student responsible.

So, make sure that your code and your output match.  If you decide
to try an alternate approach to finding an answer, clearly document
that you have done so.

Modern students rely on the Web for help.  As I note elsewhere in
this document, that's typically fine.  However, for whatever reasons,
some students neglect to cite their sources - maybe they forgot
that they looked something up, maybe they neglected to write down
the URL, maybe they don't want me to know that they needed help.
However, in many cases it's obvious to the experienced reader when
material comes from elsewhere.  And so, whether the neglect is
intentional or accidental, I must report the student.  Because I
worry about such accidental neglect, I do my best to be open about
citation.  While I like detailed citations, I accept almost anything
that acknowledges that a source was used and that points me toward
that source.

There have been times in which I know that a student has received
help from someone else and discover that that help is not acknowledged
on the work that the student turns in.  It only takes a minute to add
an acknowledgement, and it means a lot.  **Please include acknowledgements!**

Finally, there are a few instances in which I see nearly identical
solutions to a problem.  At times, that's reasonable - some problems
have only a few natural solutions and I tend to assume that two
similar common solutions were developed independently.  But when a
problem admits a huge variety of possible solutions and I see similar
solutions, or when the solutions I see are not so "natural", I am
likely to find it necessary to report the similarity.

Responding to violations
------------------------

Many years ago (long before I came to Grinnell), the Faculty of
Grinnell College decided that the analysis of and response to
potential violations of academic policy should be done by a central
committee, rather than by individual faculty members.  That decision
has been reaffirmed a number of times, as recently as Fall 2013.
(I accept that Fall 2013 may no longer seem recent to you, but it's
releatively recent in the broader academic timeframe.)
This committee is a subcommittee of the Committee on Academic
Standing (CAS).  Having a central committee helps ensure that
responses to violations are treated uniformly.  As importantly,
having a central committee ensures that the investigation is not
affected by and does not affect the relationship between the student
and the faculty member.

Because we rely on CAS to deal with potential violations of academic
integrity, faculty are asked to report such potential violations
directly to CAS and not to discuss them with students.  When I
notice such potential violations (e.g., code and output that don't
match; answers that are unexpectedly similar to resources on the
Web or to other students' answers), I typically follow a two-step
process.  First, I discuss the potential violation with one or two
colleagues in the department to see if they observe the same issues
that I do.  When that happens (and it almost always does), I then
report the potential violation to CAS, which then takes over the case.
At that point, the case is no longer under my control.

In a few instances (perhaps violations of ethical or behavior
standards, rather than strict honesty or integrity issues), I may
report the violation to the College Hearing Board (CHB), rather
than to the Committee on Academic Standing.  I follow similar
procedures for CHB to those I follow for CAS.

If CAS and CHB do not consider the violation within their purview,
I will apply the principles and approaches stated within the CS
Department's [policy on academic
integrity](https://www.cs.grinnell.edu/academic-integrity).

Academic integrity and computer science
---------------------------------------

You may have noted that this discussion of academic integrity is
particularly detailed.  There are a variety of reasons for this
level of detail.  First, as you've probably figured out by now,
whenever I write about something, I tend to write a lot about it.
And, because I've been writing about academic integrity for more than
two decades, this document has gotten longer and longer.  But that's
not the main reason.  There are at least three others.

First, as my colleague Jerod Weinman reminds me, proper citation
is an expected professional practice for computer programmers and
software designers.  If you "borrow" code from elsewhere and don't
cite it, you put your project and your company at risk to lawsuits.
(Ideally, someone reviews code and when they note that it's based
on code from elsewhere, they either seek permission to use the code
or insist that the programmers rewrite it.) For example, a proprietary
software company cannot legally use pieces of free and open-source
code that are released under the GNU Public License (GPL) unless
they arrange a separate license.

Second, as my colleague John David Stone reminds me, computer
scientists, computer programmers, and software designers may all
encounter significant pressures to behave less than ethically.  When
deadlines are tight and the rewards are great, there are temptations
to "cut corners".  We hope that by inculcating good habits now and
grounding them in sensible reasoning, we provide you with the habits
to behave appropriately, even when you encounter such pressures.

Third, the Computer Science department identifies a disproportionate
number of cases in which students appear to have violated principles
of academic integrity.  Grinnell is not alone in this disparity; I
know it happens at Harvard, too, for example.  And I've heard from
a colleage at an institution that I will not name that they reported
25% of their class.  I do not believe that this is because students
in CS are less honest.  Rather, I expect that a combination of
issues are at play.  For example, it may be easier for us to notice
copying.  In addition, it may be that there are more opportunities
for "valid" copying, but some students are not accustomed to citing
when they copy, and so neglect to do so.  Many students experience
significant pressures to succeed and those pressures lead to bad
decisions.  Other issues are also likely involved.

Whatever the reason, we report a lot.  And I *hate* to have to report such
cases.  First, I care a lot about my students, and don't like to see them
go through the stress of a hearing.  Second, it takes a lot of my time to
properly document a case, time I'd much rather spend doing work that will
improve my courses.  Third, as noted above and in the department policy,
I want to help students develop good habits and it bothers me when I fail.

Please don't make life more difficult for yourself or for me - take care
in all of your work, include a citation whenever you copy (even if you
modify after copying), and only rely on others when you are permitted
to do so.
