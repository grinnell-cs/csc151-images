# {{ page.title }}

I encourage those of you with disabilities, particularly hidden
disabilities such as learning disabilities, to come see me about
the accommodations and adjustments that I can make to make your
learning easier.  When making such accommodations and adjustments,
I prefer to work with students who have documented disabilities,
since such documentation regularly includes not only recommendations
for particular accommodations, but also general principles to help
me develop other appropriate accommodations and adjustments.

If you have not already done so, you should also discuss your
disability with [Disability 
Services](https://www.grinnell.edu/about/offices-services/academic-advising/disability-services).
If you think you may have an undocumented learning disability,
please speak to me and to Disability Services.  However, *I will work
with you whether or not you have documented the disability*.  (I
believe I am only allowed to use the term "accommodation" for cases
in which students have documented disabilities.  Other students
will find that I make appropriate "adjustments".)

In my experience, some learning difficulties can make learning
computer-related topics more difficult, particularly because computers
emphasize small details.  I also know that many of my favorite and
best students have some learning disability and have succeeded.  In
fact, many have excelled.  We'll all do better if you talk to me
about disabilities early.  I will make accommodations and adjustments
that seem to be appropriate.

Note that I generally find that the accommodations and adjustments
that I make for those with learning disabilities and differences
are appropriate for all students, so I often incorporate them as
part of the normal structure of my courses.  For example, I try to
make my notes from class available and, at least while we're online,
I'll find ways to make recordings from class available.  (I've been
making my notes available for twenty-plus years.  These days, it's
a kind of "Universal Design for Learning" practice.  Back when I 
started, it just seemed to be a good idea.)
