Introduction
------------

I like to begin each course with a meta-commentary on teaching and
learning.  Why?  Because I care about the learning process, because
I seem to have a different teaching style and personality than some
students expect, and because I want you to think not just about *what*
you are learning, but also *how* you are learning.

From my perspective, you are here to learn and I am here to support
that learning.  What will you be learning?  Clearly, you will learn
the subject matter of the course.  However, I expect that (or hope that)
you will also discover new ways to think and learn or will sharpen
existing skills.  For example, in most of my courses I hope that you
will develop your skills and working with other people and your ability
to "think on your feet".  In terms of subject matter,
I tend to care more about the processes and concepts that you learn
than about the "basic facts".

Learning is an interactive process.  You learn by asking, discussing, and
answering questions; by playing with ideas (in computer science, you also
learn by playing with programs); and by working with others.  I know from
experience that computer science cannot be learned passively: you need
to experiment with ideas (in your head, on paper, and on the computer)
in order to fully grasp these ideas.

My role
-------

How do I try to support this learning?  In a number of ways.

I *assign readings* to give you a basis for understanding the subject
matter.  Sometimes these readings will be from the textbook, sometimes
I will distribute appropriate supplements, sometimes I will write the
readings myself.

I recommend that you "read actively".  That is, when you're reading
about new ideas in Scheme, you should try some of them out to see if
you understand them and can use them.  It's certainly okay if you don't
understand everything; that's why we have labs (and short Q&amp;A sessions
at the start of most classes).

I *lecture*, *lead discussions*, and *conduct recitations* on the
topics of the course.  Sometimes these will be based on readings and
assignments, sometimes they will vary significantly from your readings.
Why?  Because I feel it wastes your time and mine to simply reiterate
the readings.  If you let me know that you're confused about a reading,
I will spend time going over that reading (either in person or in class).

To stimulate discussion and thinking, I regularly *call on students*
in class.  I know that not all of you are comfortable answering questions
publicly, but I strongly believe that you need to try.  Please feel
free to say "I'm not sure" when I call on you.  In most cases, I  call
on students randomly, typically using a stack of cards to ensure that
there is no bias.  And, at times, I'll ask for volunteers and call on
you individually.

I *assign work* because I find that most people learn by grounding
concepts in particular exercises that allow them to better explore the
details and implications of those concepts.  I expect you to turn in work
on the day it is due and will impose severe penalties on late assignments
(including refusing to accept some late assignments).

Some of my assignments may involve *public presentation* of your work.
In many cases, the best way to learn a topic is to have to discuss
it or present it to someone else.  In addition, I've found that many
students need some work on their presentation skills, and I consider it
my responsibility to help students develop those skills.  Most often,
presentations will be of papers that you've read.

**In general, I expect you to spend about eight to ten hours per week on
this class outside of class time.**  (That's about twelve-to-fifteen hours per week for our seven-week terms.)
If you find that you are spending more
than that, let me know and I'll try to reduce the workload or help you
use your time better.  If you find that you are spending significantly
less than that, please come chat with me, too.  I won't give you more
work (unless you want more work), but it may be that you are missing
some key issues.

I *grade assignments* (or ask others to grade assignments) to help you identify some areas for improvement.
Note that I believe that you learn more from doing an assignment than
from receiving a grade on that assignment.  This means that you may not
receive a grade or comments on all or even a majority of your assignments.
I will do my best to tell you when an assignment won't be graded, but
not until after you hand it in.  I will do my best to be prompt about
returning grades on assignments.  At times, I will use a grader to help
speed the process.

I *give examinations* because I find that many students only attempt
to master a concept when preparing for an exam.  Because I care more
about processes and concepts than about facts, I almost always give
partially or completely open-book examinations.  Because I do not feel 
that time limits are helpful, I primarily give take-home exams.  More
recently, I have been using mastery grading, along with corresponding
learning assessments, which means that I will be imposing time limits.

I *give quizzes* to ensure that you are doing the reading and that you
are understanding what I expect you to understand from the readings
and assignments.  At times, I will give quizzes to help illustrate a
particular point.  This term, I will be using quizzes as an opportunity
for you to complete some learning assessments.

I *build course webs* to organize my thoughts, to give you a resource for
learning, and to help those of you who need to work on your note-taking
skills.  I do my best to provide an electronic record of portions
of course.  I call this electronic record the "EBoard".  (ITS has
done enough to technology that I may be looking for alternatives to
my traditional eboards.  We shall see.)

I *make myself available* to discuss problems and questions because I
know that some of you will need personal attention.  In general, if I'm
in my office you should feel free to stop in.  Most of the time, I'll be
willing to help.  Once in a while, I'll be working on a project and will
ask you to come back later.  Students always have first priority during
office hours.  You should also feel free to send me electronic mail,
which I read regularly; and to text or call me during reasonable hours.

At times, I *survey* my students to better understand how the class is
going.  Because I do research on the effects of computers on learning,
I sometimes give surveys to gather data.  If I plan to use my surveys
for research purposes, I do my best to clear my work with the College's
Institutional Review Board (IRB).  

Your role
---------

How should you participate as a member of my class?  (Or, how do
you do well in my class?)  *By being an active participant in your
own learning.*  In part, this means doing all the work for the
class.  It also means a number of other things.

*Do the readings* in advance of each class period and come prepared
with a list of things that you don't understand.  I will often
spend time at the beginning of each class session answering these
questions or will restructure the lecture to accommodate them.  <link
linkend="anchor-reading">Further notes on reading</link> appear later
in this document.

*Come talk to me* when you have questions or comments about subject
matter, work load, or how the course is going in general.  If you
don't feel comfortable critiquing me directly, feel free to express
concerns to the class mentor or one of the tutors, who will relay
them anonymously.

*Ask and answer questions and make comments* during class periods.
I consider active participation during class a particularly important
part of the learning process.

*Begin your assignments early*.  Students who begin assignments
early have more opportunities to ask for help, to make sure that
the assignment gets completed, and to sleep at night.  Such students
also do better in general.

Reading
-------

My colleague Janet Davis suggests that you use the
[SQ3R](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQ3R) method when reading.  I've
paraphrased her description of the SQ3R steps, as I believe she
paraphrased the information from elsewhere.

* *Survey*.  Skim the material to get a big picture
  and to see what's important.  You might read the introduction or
  abstract and the summary in a bit more depth.  You should also look
  at the headings to get an overall sense of the reading.
* *Question*.  You are reading something to learn.
  Ideally, you learn by asking questions.  So, figure out what questions
  you think the reading will answer.  (And no, "Why is Rebelsky
  making me read this?" is not an adequate question.)  Your
  initial survey should help you figure out good questions to ask.
* *Read*.  Read the work thoroughly, considering
  how it answers the questions you've asked and what additional
  questions it might raise.
* *Recite*.  Check that you can answer your
  questions, in your own words, without referring back to the
  reading.
* *Review*.  Verify that you've answered the
  questions.  Figure out what's still left unanswered.  (It's okay
  if some things are still unanswered, particularly questions that
  came up along the way.  We're here to help you figure out answers.)

Lecturing
---------

I seem to have a different "lecturing" style than some students expect.
As I mentioned earlier, I don't think it is the purpose of lecture is
to reiterate the readings; students should come to class having done
the readings.  I do, however, think lecture and readings can provide
alternate perspectives on the subject matter.  At times, I will also
discuss issues not covered in any readings.

I see no point in going on with a lecture or example if many students
don't understand what's going on.  *You are the first line of defense
against wasted class time*: **Stop me when you are confused**.  In
addition, I will occasionally stop the class and ask for a show of hands
to see who is confused.  Don't be embarrassed to raise your hand; if you
are confused, it is likely that someone else is also confused.  I realize
that this show of hands leads to some "pressure for understanding".
However, you won't get much out of a class if you're confused (and
therefore just copying down what I'm writing without thinking about it).

I deem it important for students to be active participants in lecture.
This means that I will often ask you to help develop algorithms, solve
problems, and even critique each other's answers.  I tend to call on
students randomly, rather than to use volunteers.  If I call on you
and you're not sure of an answer, feel free to say "I don't know" or
to venture a guess.  I consider it very important for all of us to see
the problem solving process, warts and all.  Note that I often generate
examples of discussion "on the fly" so that we can all be involved in
the problem solving or development process.

It's more than CS
-----------------

While I teach courses in computer science, I hope that students in
my courses leave with more than just more knowledge of CS.  In particular,
I expect students to have developed some problem-solving skills, some
thinking skills, and even some discussion (or at least quick reaction to
recitation questions) skills.  I would hope you find the same in all
Grinnell classes.

Summary
-------

As the prior discussion suggests, I expect a great deal from my students.
I also use many different strategies to get the best out of you.  Feel free
to discuss any of this with me (anything from concerns about this perspective
to suggestions on improving teaching and learning).
