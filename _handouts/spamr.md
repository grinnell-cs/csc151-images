## [CSC-151-01 2024Sp] Mentor/Tutor Evaluations + Quizzes + More (Monday, 2024-04-22)

Dear Word Hashers,

1. I had promised you a token if at least 63% of you filled in the mentor/tutor evaluations. We are currently slightly under 50%. If you have not done so already, please fill out the mentor/tutor evaluation asap.

_URL elided._

2. I've added a few more token submission slots on Gradescope. Let me know if you need more.

3. Friday's quizzes are now available on Gradescope.

4. The Hilma Af Klint Catalogue Raisonné and two other books are now in our classroom. Please do not remove them from the classroom.

Have a great day!

## [CSC-151-01 2024Sp] Word clouds! (Saturday, 2024-04-20)

Dear future makers of cloud-like constructions,

I hope you are having a wonderful weekend and that you were able to enjoy some of today's events in the too-cold weather.

Thanks for your (mostly) thoughtful responses on the pre-reflection for MP8. I've added some short comments to your reflections, which Gradescope will now tell you about.

> View your graded work.

> Link not working? Please see our Why can't I see my grades? FAQ article for further information.

> If you have never logged in to this site before, you can set your password. The login for your Gradescope account is username@grinnell.edu. (If you have any problems accessing the site, please contact help@gradescope.com.)

Wasn't that fascinating? I know that the links had me breathless.

In any case, I appreciate your comments.

I'll note that I would have preferred more of you to give the name, parameters, and purpose of each procedure you were suggesting in your decomposition. Certainly, I find it easier to decompose if I can just refer to these procedures. "I'll just call `file->hash` here", or something like that.

I've added the new questions to the end of the mini-project.

I've also gathered most of your suggestions into a document.

<https://rebelsky.cs.grinnell.edu/Courses/CSC151/2024Sp/handouts/word-clouds>

Since not all of you were equally successful in decomposing the problem, I think you'll benefit from seeing some of your classmates' ideas. Don't feel obligated to use them all! There are different approaches embedded in the answers.

What else? Oh! I think of this project as having three central topics: hash tables, decomposition, and practice with open-ended projects. Of course, you'll also have the opportunity to practice many other skills, such as recursion and (potentially) the use of randomness.

I think that's it for now. I should be on Teams on Sunday if you find that you have questions.

Regards,

## [CSC-151-01 2024Sp] Grade reports and more (Sunday, 2024-03-31)

Dear Breakers of Springs,

I hope you are well and that you are excited about returning to classes.

Our graders are still working on MP5 and recent MP redos. They hope to have them done soon.

I've caught up on the LAs, readings, and metacognitive reflections. You should be able to find helpful (or at least sarcastic) comments on them on Gradescope as well as answers to most questions.

I'll be sending out your latest grade reports in a few minutes. Let me know if you have questions.

Don't forget to do the reading on randomness (due tonight) and the pre-reflection for MP6 (due Monday night)!

Regards,

-- SamR

## [CSC-151-01 2024Sp] Change in location for the Grinnell Lecture (Thursday, 11am, HSSC auditorium (A2231))

Dear cons-tellation of 151ers,

I hope you feel more in tune with car, cdr, and cons and their effects. We'll return to their use on Monday, when we start on the wonders of recursion.

I have received a notification that the Grinnell Lecture has been moved to the HSSC auditorium (A2231).

I look forward to seeing many of you there.

Regards,

-- SamR

## [CSC-151-01 2024Sp] Whoops! (Tuesday, 2024-02-27)

Dear list makers and manipulators,

Apologies! I forgot to update the date in my "send mail" script, so you likely received email that said "2023Fa" instead of "2024Sp". I apologize for any confusion.

See you Wednesday!

-- SamR

## [CSC-151-01 2024Sp] Grade Reports Forthoming (Tuesday, 2024-02-27)

Dear Shape Shifters,

I hope that you are doing well and are making good progress on MP4. Bring questions to class!

In a few minutes, I'll be sending out grade reports. These reports let you see what records I currently have for you in the course.

Note that we have not yet graded the redo for MP2, so your grade on that will likely affect other things. At the point I downloaded grades from Gradescope, not all of you had done the reading for class 17, so some of you have that listed as missing.

Don't worry if you still have a few missing LAs! You'll be able to catch up on SoLA 2.

Don't worry if your mini-projects are mostly R's (or even a few I's). You should be able to get them to M's and E's. Make sure to talk to the evening tutors for help, to ask me questions on Teams, or to sign up for office hours.

Feel free to bring general questions about the grade reports to class tomorrow!

## [CSC-151-01 2024Sp] Finding Sam today (Thursday) / Office Hours / Mentor Session (Thursday, 2024-02-01)

Dear Talented Tracers,

Happy Leap February!

1\. Finding Sam Today

I'll be hanging out in our classroom (Science 3813) from 8:00-10:30 and from 2:00-3:30 today (Thursday) to answer questions from students. I have one student who booked time at 10:00 a.m., but other than that, it will be more-or-less first come, first served.

2\. Office Hours

Starting next week, my regular office hours will be Tuesday 10:00-11:30 and Thursday 2:00-3:30. I should have those up on bookings soon.

3\. Mentor Session

The ever-amazing Maddy Thompson will be hosting a mentor session tonight at 8pm in Science 3819 (down the hall from our classroom). Maddy plans to discuss tracing and to answer other questions.

4\. Quiz

Don't forget our Quiz protocol. Arrive in class. Grab the quiz. Grab a card. Navigate to a computer. Take the quiz. Wait until 8:45 a.m. for Sam to start class.

You may arrive as early as 7:45 a.m.

5\. Welcome to our new class members! You'll meet two more on Friday.

- - -

As always, feel free to DM me on teams. (Is that "TM me"? Does that mean applying for a trademark? Transcendental meditation? No, it's just "Teams Message".)

Regards,

-- SamR

## [CSC-151-01 2024Fa] More Token Activities (Monday, 2024-01-29)

Dear Stackers of Simulated Snowballs,

It appears that I forgot a host of token events, many of which occur on Tuesday this week. I'm passing them along in case they are interest to any of you.

Tuesday, 2024-01-30, noon, JRC 224A: _CS Table_. CS Table is a weekly meeting of people interested in talking about CS, most frequently about the societal aspects of CS. If you aren't on a meal plan, you can sign in on the sign-in sheet.

Tuesday, 2024-01-30, noon, BRAC P103 (Multipurpose Dance Studio): _HIIT & Strength Fitness Class_.

Tuesday, 2024-01-30, 4pm, BRAC P103 (Multipurpose Dance Studio): _Yoga_.

Tuesday, 2024-01-30, 4pm, HSSC S2377: _SPARK Information Session_. SPARK is a social good innovation challenge. Come and hear more!

Thursday, 2024-02-01, 4pm, Science 3821: _CS Extras: Summer research_. While it's unlikely that CSC-151 students will be eligible for research this summer, you may find it useful to hear what kinds of research the faculty are planning.

Friday, 2024-02-02, 8pm, Harris Concert Hall: _Weekend Murder Mystery_.

Let me know if you have other things to suggest. I see that Men's Tennis and the Swim Team have home meets this weekend. I can't recall if I have any swimmers, divers, or tennis players.

Regards,

-- SamR

## [CSC-151-01 2024Fa] Notes in preparation for Quiz 1 (Thursday, 2024-01-25)

Dear Beginning Image Makers,

I hope you are having a pleasant day.

A few of you have been asking about tomorrow's quiz, which I conveniently forgot to mention in class on Wednesday.  Here's some relevant info.

**Process**

When you arrive in class, you will grab a quiz, grab a computer name card, figure out where the computer is, drop the card in the jar, navigate to the computer, and start the quiz.

Most students will arrive at 8:30-ish.

Those who have accommodations indicating extra time and those who feel they would need extra time can arrive at 8:15.

I will start class at 8:45. Maddy will collect the quizzes at that time.

If you finish early, you can log in to the computer, start DrRacket, and direct the Web browser to the lab. (Don't start until your partner is ready.) You can also sit and read on your phone, or just relax and meditate (we don't take enough time to do so).

**Topic**

The first quiz will be on decomposition. We will give you a compound image and ask you to decompose it (something like in the reading). Here's an example.

<https://rebelsky.cs.grinnell.edu/Courses/CSC151/2024Sp/las/decomposition.html>

**Notes**

Normally, we will not give quizzes on topics you haven't done a lab on. This week, we have not yet covered any quiz topic, so we are giving this quiz primarily so that you can see what quizzes are like in 151. Don't stress about it (either in preparation or when you see the quiz).

You are new to Scheme and to the image library. As long as your answer is close, you'll get credit. (That is, your syntax need not be perfect.)

Let me know if you have further questions.

Regards,

-- SamR

## [CSC-151-01 2024Sp] Assignments and such (Monday, 2023-01-22)

Dear Sandwich Specifiers,

Thanks for a good first day of class. And CONGRATULATIONS on getting done quickly enough that we could start our debrief. Sorry about the computer problems; I hope to have those solved before the next class.

1. You have a bunch of readings for the next class.

    <https://rebelsky.cs.grinnell.edu/Courses/CSC151/2024Sp/readings/mathlan.html>

    <https://rebelsky.cs.grinnell.edu/Courses/CSC151/2024Sp/readings/algorithm-building-blocks.html>

    <https://rebelsky.cs.grinnell.edu/Courses/CSC151/2024Sp/readings/drracket.html>

    <https://rebelsky.cs.grinnell.edu/Courses/CSC151/2024Sp/readings/intro-scheme.html>

2. The last reading has three "Self Check" problems marked with double daggers (‡). You should enter your answers to those problems on the reading assignment on Gradescope.  **Those are due by 11pm on Tuesday.** I am more likely to read over the ones that I receive by 8pm on Tuesday.

    <https://www.gradescope.com/courses/690100/assignments/3974526/>

3. Like many classes, CSC-151 has an introductory survey. You can find it at

    <https://www.gradescope.com/courses/690100/assignments/3974524/>

    It is due by 11pm on Wednesday, but you should try to get it done earlier.

4. As I mentioned, I'd like you to read the syllabus on your own and answer some questions. You can find that assignment at

    <https://www.gradescope.com/courses/690100/assignments/3974523/>
    
    It is also due by 11pm on Wednesday, but you should try to get it done earlier.

5. You might also reflect on what else you learned from the PB&J (well, Almond Butter and Jam) exercise.

Regards,

-- SamR

## [CSC-151-01 2024Sp] Welcome to CSC-151! (Sunday, 2024-01-20)

Dear CSC-151-01 Students,

Welcome back to campus! I hope that you had a good winter break and that you are excited to return to intensive learning. I also hope that you are coping with Iowa's wonderful winter temperatures. A few pre-course notes.

1. The course Web site may be found at <https://rebelsky.cs.grinnell.edu/Courses/CSC151/2024Sp/>.  It is likely to change a bit leading up to the first day of class and will continue to evolve throughout the semester.

2. If you've never been to Noyce 3rd before, it may be a little complex to find our classroom.  Science 3813 is near the northwest end of the third floor of Noyce. There are stairways from the first floor to the third floor at the northeast and northwest corners of Noyce. The elevator to the third floor is slightly south of the northeast corner.

    If you aren't sure about your cardinal directions, the JRC is NORTH of Noyce (as is 8th Avenue) and the railroad tracks are EAST of Noyce.

3. There is no textbook for CSC-151. We provide all of the necessary materials online.

4. You need not do anything in preparation for the first day of class.

I've probably forgotten something. When I remember, I'll either send you another email or mention it in class on Monday.

I look forward to meeting you bright and early on Monday morning!

Regards,

-- SamR

p.s. Feel free to send questions via email or via direct message on Teams.
