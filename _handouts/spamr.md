## [CSC-151 2025Sp] Welcome to the course! (Tuesday, 2024-01-21)

Dear CSC-151 2025Sp Students,

Welcome to the course! I hope you had a wonderful winter break and that you are finding ways to cope with our terrifyingly cold weather.

Just so you know, I do not use Blackboard. Most of the material for the course will be posted online on our course web site at <https://rebelsky.cs.grinnell.edu/Courses/CSC151/2025Sp/>.

Your first assignments, due at 10:30 p.m. this Thursday, are to review the course syllabus and accompanying documents, to report on what you've learned from reading them, and to tell me a bit about yourself. You will submit these assignments via Gradescope.

Course details: <https://www.gradescope.com/courses/948769/assignments/5638758>

Introductory survey: <https://www.gradescope.com/courses/948769/assignments/5638761>

Please let me know if you have difficulty accessing any of these resources. You will also receive some reading assignments to do by Thursday night.

We will also use Microsoft Teams for the course. I believe I have added you to the Course Team. If not, please let me know.

I'm also happy to take questions and comments in person (usually after class or during office hours), via email, or via Teams (chat or our Q&A channel).

Regards,

-- SamR
