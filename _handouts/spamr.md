## [CSC-151-01 2024Fa] More Token Activities (Monday, 2024-01-29)

Dear Stackers of Simulated Snowballs,

It appears that I forgot a host of token events, many of which occur on Tuesday this week. I'm passing them along in case they are interest to any of you.

Tuesday, 2024-01-30, noon, JRC 224A: _CS Table_. CS Table is a weekly meeting of people interested in talking about CS, most frequently about the societal aspects of CS. If you aren't on a meal plan, you can sign in on the sign-in sheet.

Tuesday, 2024-01-30, noon, BRAC P103 (Multipurpose Dance Studio): _HIIT & Strength Fitness Class_.

Tuesday, 2024-01-30, 4pm, BRAC P103 (Multipurpose Dance Studio): _Yoga_.

Tuesday, 2024-01-30, 4pm, HSSC S2377: _SPARK Information Session_. SPARK is a social good innovation challenge. Come and hear more!

Thursday, 2024-02-01, 4pm, Science 3821: _CS Extras: Summer research_. While it's unlikely that CSC-151 students will be eligible for research this summer, you may find it useful to hear what kinds of research the faculty are planning.

Friday, 2024-02-02, 8pm, Harris Concert Hall: _Weekend Murder Mystery_.

Let me know if you have other things to suggest. I see that Men's Tennis and the Swim Team have home meets this weekend. I can't recall if I have any swimmers, divers, or tennis players.

Regards,

## [CSC-151-01 2024Fa] Notes in preparation for Quiz 1 (Thursday, 2024-01-25)

Dear Beginning Image Makers,

I hope you are having a pleasant day.

A few of you have been asking about tomorrow's quiz, which I conveniently forgot to mention in class on Wednesday.  Here's some relevant info.

**Process**

When you arrive in class, you will grab a quiz, grab a computer name card, figure out where the computer is, drop the card in the jar, navigate to the computer, and start the quiz.

Most students will arrive at 8:30-ish.

Those who have accommodations indicating extra time and those who feel they would need extra time can arrive at 8:15.

I will start class at 8:45. Maddy will collect the quizzes at that time.

If you finish early, you can log in to the computer, start DrRacket, and direct the Web browser to the lab. (Don't start until your partner is ready.) You can also sit and read on your phone, or just relax and meditate (we don't take enough time to do so).

**Topic**

The first quiz will be on decomposition. We will give you a compound image and ask you to decompose it (something like in the reading). Here's an example.

<https://rebelsky.cs.grinnell.edu/Courses/CSC151/2024Sp/las/decomposition.html>

**Notes**

Normally, we will not give quizzes on topics you haven't done a lab on. This week, we have not yet covered any quiz topic, so we are giving this quiz primarily so that you can see what quizzes are like in 151. Don't stress about it (either in preparation or when you see the quiz).

You are new to Scheme and to the image library. As long as your answer is close, you'll get credit. (That is, your syntax need not be perfect.)

Let me know if you have further questions.

Regards,

-- SamR

## [CSC-151-01 2024Sp] Assignments and such (Monday, 2023-01-22)

Dear Sandwich Specifiers,

Thanks for a good first day of class. And CONGRATULATIONS on getting done quickly enough that we could start our debrief. Sorry about the computer problems; I hope to have those solved before the next class.

1. You have a bunch of readings for the next class.

    <https://rebelsky.cs.grinnell.edu/Courses/CSC151/2024Sp/readings/mathlan.html>

    <https://rebelsky.cs.grinnell.edu/Courses/CSC151/2024Sp/readings/algorithm-building-blocks.html>

    <https://rebelsky.cs.grinnell.edu/Courses/CSC151/2024Sp/readings/drracket.html>

    <https://rebelsky.cs.grinnell.edu/Courses/CSC151/2024Sp/readings/intro-scheme.html>

2. The last reading has three "Self Check" problems marked with double daggers (â€¡). You should enter your answers to those problems on the reading assignment on Gradescope.  **Those are due by 11pm on Tuesday.** I am more likely to read over the ones that I receive by 8pm on Tuesday.

    <https://www.gradescope.com/courses/690100/assignments/3974526/>

3. Like many classes, CSC-151 has an introductory survey. You can find it at

    <https://www.gradescope.com/courses/690100/assignments/3974524/>

    It is due by 11pm on Wednesday, but you should try to get it done earlier.

4. As I mentioned, I'd like you to read the syllabus on your own and answer some questions. You can find that assignment at

    <https://www.gradescope.com/courses/690100/assignments/3974523/>
    
    It is also due by 11pm on Wednesday, but you should try to get it done earlier.

5. You might also reflect on what else you learned from the PB&J (well, Almond Butter and Jam) exercise.

Regards,

-- SamR

## [CSC-151-01 2024Sp] Welcome to CSC-151! (Sunday, 2024-01-20)

Dear CSC-151-01 Students,

Welcome back to campus! I hope that you had a good winter break and that you are excited to return to intensive learning. I also hope that you are coping with Iowa's wonderful winter temperatures. A few pre-course notes.

1. The course Web site may be found at <https://rebelsky.cs.grinnell.edu/Courses/CSC151/2024Sp/>.  It is likely to change a bit leading up to the first day of class and will continue to evolve throughout the semester.

2. If you've never been to Noyce 3rd before, it may be a little complex to find our classroom.  Science 3813 is near the northwest end of the third floor of Noyce. There are stairways from the first floor to the third floor at the northeast and northwest corners of Noyce. The elevator to the third floor is slightly south of the northeast corner.

    If you aren't sure about your cardinal directions, the JRC is NORTH of Noyce (as is 8th Avenue) and the railroad tracks are EAST of Noyce.

3. There is no textbook for CSC-151. We provide all of the necessary materials online.

4. You need not do anything in preparation for the first day of class.

I've probably forgotten something. When I remember, I'll either send you another email or mention it in class on Monday.

I look forward to meeting you bright and early on Monday morning!

Regards,

-- SamR

p.s. Feel free to send questions via email or via direct message on Teams.
