title: Naming values with local bindings
summary: |
  In this laboratory, you will ground your understanding of the basic
  techniques for locally naming values and procedures in Scheme, `let`
  and `let*`.
---

<!--
Your team should decide who will take the A-side and B-sides of the lab.
Each member should download the appropriate code:

+ [local-bindings-a.rkt]({{ "/code/labs/local-bindings-a.rkt" | relative_url }})
+ [local-bindings-b.rkt]({{ "/code/labs/local-bindings-b.rkt" | relative_url }})

And follow the instructions in your respective files!
When you are done, combine the files, rename the result to `local-bindings.rkt`, and upload the completed lab to Gradescope.
-->

For now (and perhaps for the foreseeable future), the person closest to the board is Side A.
The other person is Side B.

Download the code from

* [local-bindings.rkt]({{ "/code/labs/local-bindings.rkt" | relative_url }})

and follow the instructions.

When you are done, make sure to save the file as text and then upload the completed lab to Gradescope.
