## Preparation

a. Have the standard start-of-lab conversations.

b. Grab your code files

* [mergesort.rkt](../code/labs/mergesort.rkt)

c. Review any provided code at the top of the file to see what is
new.  You should feel free to quickly experiment with any new
procedures, but we'll also be looking at most of them in the lab.
