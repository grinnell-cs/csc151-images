title: Recursion basics
summary: |
  In this laboratory, you will explore the basics of recursion over lists
  by reading and interpreting some recursive procedures.
todo: |
  For the in-person lab, most groups barely make it through problem 2
  in fifty minutes.  How do we make the lab shorter?  The traces are
  helpful.

In this lab, we'll gain some intuition about the *mechanics* of recursion by practicing reading and interpreting recursive code using our mental model of computation.

## Important procedures

## Preparation

a. Introduce yourself to your partner, discuss your preferred work processes, your stengths, and other issues you deem important.

<!--
b. Decide who is side A and who is side B.  

A side: [recursion-basics-a.rkt](../code/labs/recursion-basics-a.rkt)

B side: [recursion-basics-b.rkt](../code/labs/recursion-basics-b.rkt)
-->

b. Grab the code from the following link.  Side A will be the person
closer to the board.

* [recursion-basics.rkt](../code/labs/recursion-basics.rkt)

c. Review the procedures included in the lab to make sure you
understand what they are intended to do.
