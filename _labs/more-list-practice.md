  In this laboratory, you will contineu practicing writing recursive procedures over lists.
---

In this lab, we'll continue practicing designing recursive functions over lists, focusing on the _list motions_ discussed in the reading.
We'll also look at one example, `intersperse`, where we need more beyond our recursive skeleton.

## Preparation

a. Introduce yourself to your partner, discuss strengths and weaknesses,
decide upon work procedures, etc.

b. Load the lab.
