title: Vectors
summary: |
  In this laboratory, you will explore vectors, an alternative to
  lists for storing sequences of values.
note: | 
  in 2021Fa, there were more problems and students only go through
  the first four.  So I split the lab.

## Preparation

a. If you have not done so, please conduct the normal "start of class
algorithm".  Introduce yourself to your partner.  Discuss work habits,
strengths, and areas to improve.

b. Grab the code for the lab.

* [vectors.rkt](../code/labs/vectors.rkt)

c. Review the documentation for the supplied procedures to
ensure you understand what they are suposed to do.  If you're
not sure, feel free to experiment or to ask the staff.

## Acknowledgements

This lab has gone through many revisions throughout the years.
The earliest version available is available at
<https://rebelsky.cs.grinnell.edu/Courses/CS151/2000F/Labs/vectors.html>
and appears to bear little resemblance to the current lab.  That
suggests that it has been updated by many hands over the years.
Samuel A. Rebelsky is likely responsible for the helper code.
