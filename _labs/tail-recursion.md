title: (Optional) Tail and helper recursion
summary: |
  In this laboratory, you will explore recursive procedures
  in which we pass along intermediate computations, most typically
  using a *recursive helper procedure*.  When this technique is used in
  conjunction with a program structure in which the recursive result
  is returned directly (without accumulated actions to perform), this
  technique supports *tail recursion*.
todo: |  
  Consider rewriting the maxima problem to use strings.

In this lab, we'll further expand our understanding of recursion, considering how patterns (both pattern matching and patterns of recursion) and helper procedures improve our ability to recurse.

## Preparation

1. Introduce yourself to your partner, discuss strengths and weaknesses, work work procedures, and such.

2. Go over your answers to the self checks.

3. Grab the code.

* [tail-recursion.scm](../code/labs/tail-recursion.rkt)

d. Review the provided procedures.

## Acknowledgements

This lab was rewritten in Spring 2023 based on previous tail recursion labs, the most recent of which was Fall 2021.
