title: List recursion, revisited
summary: |
  In this laboratory, you will continue to practice writing recursive procedures.
todo: 
  - TBD
---

In this lab, we'll gain some intuition about the mechanics of recursion by practicing writing recursive code.


## Preparation

a. Introduce yourself to your partner, discuss strengths and weaknesses,
decide upon work procedures, etc.

b. Load the lab.

* [list-recursion-revisited.rkt](../code/labs/list-recursion-revisited.rkt)

c. Review the procedures included in the lab to make sure that you
know what they are intended to do.

## Acknowledgements

The last few problems on the lab are taken directly from the
[recursion practice lab](../labs/recursion-practice.html).  However,
it appears they are much older, perhaps dating back to one of the
first few offerings of CSC-151 in the late 1990's.
