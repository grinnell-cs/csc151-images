title: Higher-order recursion
summary: |
  In this laboratory, you will explore the intersection of higher-order
  programming and recursion.
todo: 
  - Replace the make-muliplier procedure with something a bit more interesting.

In this lab, we'll further expand our understanding of recursion, considering how patterns (both pattern matching and patterns of recursion) and helper procedures improve our ability to recurse.

## Preparation

a. Introduce yourself to your partner, discuss strengths and weaknesses, work work procedures, and such.

b. Go over your answers to the self checks.

c. Grab the code

* [higher-order-recursion.rkt](../code/labs/higher-order-recursion.rkt)
