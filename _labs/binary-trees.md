title: Binary trees
summary: |
  In this laboratory, we explore the use of binary trees and ways to process them.
---
## Preparation

a. Have the normal start of lab conversation.  Introduce yourselves (on the off chance you haven't met each other yet).  Describe strengths and weaknesses.  Talk about work approaches.  

b. Grab the code file

* [binary-trees.scm](../code/labs/binary-trees.scm)

c. Review any provided code at the top of the file to see what is
new.  You should feel free to quickly experiment with any new
procedures, but we'll also be looking at most of them in the lab.

d. Review the self checks from the readings.

## Acknowledgements

This lab was created in Fall 2020 as a hybrid of a wide variety of prior labs on binary trees.
It was revised significantly in Fall 2021.
There were additional revisions in Spring 2022.
