In this lab, we'll continue our exploration of recursion by considering how we might recurse over numbers.

## Preparation

1. Introduce yourself to your partner, discuss strengths and weaknesses, agree upon work procedures, etc.
2. The person nearest the board is Side A.  The other person is Side B. Grab the code from 
    + [numeric-recursion.scm](../code/labs/numeric-recursion.scm)
3. Review the procedures included in the lab to make sure you understand what they are intended to do.
