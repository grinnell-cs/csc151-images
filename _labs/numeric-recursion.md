  In this laboratory, you will explore the basics of recursion over natural
  numbers.

In this lab, we'll continue our exploration of recursion by considering how
we might recurse over numbers.

## Preparation

a. Introduce yourself to your partner, discuss strengths and weaknesses,
agree upon work procedures, etc.

<!--
b. Decide who is side A and who is side B.  

A side: [numeric-recursion-a.rkt](../code/labs/numeric-recursion-a.rkt)

B side: [numeric-recursion-b.rkt](../code/labs/numeric-recursion-b.rkt)
-->

b. The person nearest the board is Side A.  The other person is Side B.
Grab the code from 

* [numeric-recursion.rkt](../code/labs/numeric-recursion.rkt)

c. Review the procedures included in the lab to make sure you
understand what they are intended to do.
