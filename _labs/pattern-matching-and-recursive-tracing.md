title: Pattern Matching and Recursive Tracing
summary: |
  In this laboratory, you will explore the recursive definition of lists,
  trace through recursive code, and learn about the `match` expression.
---

In this lab, we'll gain some intuition about the *mechanics* of recursion by practicing reading and interpreting recursive code using our mental model of computation.

## Preparation

a. Introduce yourself to your partner, discuss your preferred work processes, your strengths, and other issues you deem important.

b. Grab the code from the following link.

* [pattern-matching-and-recursive-tracing.scm]({{ "/code/labs/pattern-matching-and-recursive-tracing.scm" | relative_url }})
