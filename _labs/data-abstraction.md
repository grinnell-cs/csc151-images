title: Data abstraction
summary: |
  In this laboratory, we explore the use of data abstraction to separate
  the interface of a type from its implementation.
notes: | 
  In Fall 2022, a fifty-minute lab got people about midway through exercise 4.

## Preparation

a. Have the traditional start-of-lab conversation.

b. Quickly review your answers to the self-check problems from the reading.

<!--
c. Decide which partner will be Side A and which partner will be Side B.

d. Grab your respective code files

* [data-abstraction-a.rkt](../code/labs/data-abstraction-a.rkt)
* [data-abstraction-b.rkt](../code/labs/data-abstraction-b.rkt)

e. Grab four associated library files.

* [names-as-lists.rkt](../code/labs/names-as-lists.rkt)
* [names-as-vectors.rkt](../code/labs/names-as-vectors.rkt)
* [names-as-hash-tables.rkt](../code/labs/names-as-hash-tables.rkt)
* [names-as-bar-strings.rkt](../code/labs/names-as-bar-strings.rkt)

e. Review the supplied procedures, which should be similar to those
from [the reading](../readings/data-abstraction).

## Acknowledgements

This lab was (mostly) newly written in spring 2021.  In spring 2022,
the different implementations were moved to separate files.
