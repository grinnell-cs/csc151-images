title: Pairs and pair structures
summary: |
  In this laboratory, you will further ground your understanding
  of what happens "behind the scenes" when Scheme deals with lists
  and other pair-based structures.
---

## Preparation

a. This lab will require you to draw out diagrams of pairs, so make sure to have a piece of paper handy!

b. If you have not done so, please conduct the normal "start of class
algorithm".  Introduce yourself to your partner.  Discuss work habits,
strengths, and areas to improve.

c. Grab the code for the lab.

* [pairs.rkt](../code/labs/pairs.rkt)

d. Review the documentation for the supplied procedures to
ensure you understand what they are suposed to do.  If you're
not sure, feel free to experiment or to ask the staff.

## Acknowledgements

This lab has gone through many hands and any iterations.  It has
been combined with other topics (vectors, hash tables, etc.) and
then been separated out again.  In Fall 2021, Samuel A. Rebelsky
moved the primary instructions to a separate code file, following 
a pattern begun by Peter-Michael Osera in Fall 2020.  (Osera
had combined pairs with another topic, so Rebelsky took a new
stab at the lab.)
