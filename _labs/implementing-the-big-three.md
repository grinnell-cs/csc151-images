title: Implementing the Big Three
summary: |
  In this laboratory, you will explore an advanced topics in recursion: building the higher-order recursive functions that we studied earlier in the course, "the big three."
---

In this lab, we'll combine higher-order functions and recursion to see how to implement `map`, `filter`, and `fold`.

## Preparation

a. Introduce yourself to your partner, discuss strengths and weaknesses,
agree upon work procedures, etc.

b. The person nearest the board is Side A. The other person is Side B.
Grab the code from:
