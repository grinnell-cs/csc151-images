summary: |
  In this laboratory, we experimentally analyze the complexity of various Scamper programs.

## Preparation

a. Have the normal start of lab conversation.  Introduce yourselves (on the off chance you haven't met each other yet).  Describe strengths and weaknesses.  Talk about work approaches.  

b. Grab the code file

* [computational-complexity.scm](../code/labs/computational-complexity.scm)

c. Review any provided code at the top of the file to see what is
new.  You should feel free to quickly experiment with any new
procedures, but we'll also be looking at most of them in the lab.
