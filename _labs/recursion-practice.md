In this lab, we'll gain some intuition about the mechanics of recursion by practicing reading, rewriting, and writing recursive code.

## Important procedures

_Forthcoming._

## Preparation

<!--
a. Introduce yourself to your partner, discuss work procedures, who
will submit the lab.

b. Decide who is side A and who is side B.  

A side: [recursion-practice-a.rkt](../code/labs/recursion-practice-a.rkt)

B side: [recursion-practice-b.rkt](../code/labs/recursion-practice-b.rkt)

c. Review the procedures included in the lab to make sure you
understand what they are intended to do.
