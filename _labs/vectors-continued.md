c. Get started!

## Acknowledgements

This lab has gone through many revisions throughout the years.
The earliest version Sam could find is available at
<https://rebelsky.cs.grinnell.edu/Courses/CS151/2000F/Labs/vectors.html>
and appears to bear little resemblance to the current lab.  That
suggests that it has been updated by many hands over the years.

In 2022Sp, the lab was split into two parts.  This part of the lab
likely bears closer resemblance to the earliest lab.
