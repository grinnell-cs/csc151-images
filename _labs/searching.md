## Preparation

a. Conduct the standard start-of-lab discussion.

b. Grab the code file.

* [searching.rkt](../code/labs/searching.rkt)

c. Spend no more than five minutes reviewing any provided code at the top of the file to see what is new.
You should feel free to quickly experiment with any new procedures, but we'll also be looking at most of them in the lab.

## Acknowledgements

This lab was created in Fall 2020 as a hybrid of a wide variety of prior labs.
This lab was revised in Fall 2021 to make it a bit shorter. It's probably been revised slightly since.
