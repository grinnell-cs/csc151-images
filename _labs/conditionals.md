summary: |
  In this lab, you will have the opportunity to explore the use of
  predicates as well as Scheme's primary conditional control
  operations, `if` and `cond`.

notes: |
  This lab is long.  It probably requires two days of class.  Perhaps
    we should leave the ZoB stuff for another day.
  We might want to add a tracing problem that doesn't use #t and #f.

We may have reached the point in which you need fewer instructions.  So
let's give it a try.

We will use the now-standard approach for this lab.
The person who arrived at the computer first is side A.
The other person is side B.  

Start by making a copy of the code.

* [conditionals.scm]({{ "/code/labs/conditionals.scm" | relative_url }})

Then follow the instructions in the file.

Don't forget to submit the file on Gradescope, to include your partner when submitting, and to email the code to your partner.
