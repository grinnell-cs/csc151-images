The starter code for this project is [image-series.rkt](../code/mps/image-series.rkt).

Preliminaries
-------------

While the primary focus of this course is on learning how to write, describe, test, and analyze algorithms, our secondary focus is on writing algorithms that generate "interesting" images. We've created images with basic shapes, transformed existing images using color transformations, designed images as functions from positions to colors, and even wrote procedures that work with individual pixels.

At the same time, you've learned a variety of techniques for doing complex computations, particularly a variety of kinds of recursion (over lists, arbitrarily nested lists, pair structures, vectors, and numbers). You've also considered a variety of ways to store compound/complex data, including lists, vectors, pairs and pair structures, nested lists, and hash tables.

We also hope that you've learned a bit about working with other people as well as the different kinds of strengths that people bring to problem solving.

It is now time for you to bring your skills and knowledge together to in a new way. We are going to use our knowledge of CS in the service of a task both creative and analytic. In particular, we are going to write a procedure that heps us better understand a work of art.

Coding as analysis
------------------

As you may know, a multitude of (mostly) hidden design decisions go into each work an artist makes. As the audience for the work, we might develop better appreciation of the work as we "tease out" some of those design decisions. One way that both artists and art historians sometimes analyze works and their design decisions is to make variants of the work. "What happens if I move this one thing?" "What happens if I use a slightly different color?" "A different aspect ratio?"

One of the nice things about computers is that they can let us write procedures that make variants of an image. Rather than drawing one variant of an image by hand, we can write a proram that makes dozens or even hundreds of variants. The ability to generate variants helps us better understand the original image. At the same time, it lets us "create" in that we can now make a Warholesque trove of variants.

How many is enough? We'd like you to write a procedure that can make at least 1,000 different (but related) images, all based on a single starting image. What "at least 1,000"? So that we can subtitle the project "a procedure is worth a thousand pictures" (a play on the aphorism "a picture is worth a thousand words").

Project specification
---------------------

Our computational image-making skills are not yet at the level that we can use them to make realistic representational art. Hence, in this project, we will focus on abstract art, particularly somewhat geometic abstract art. In part, such art matches our knowledge and skill sets. In part, analyzing such art may help us better understand what makes a particular work compelling.

This semester, will apply the "code as analysis" technique to the works of Hilma af Klint.  As Wikipedia tells us, "Hilma af Klint was a Swedish artist and mystic whose paintings are considered among the first abstract works known in Western art history. A considerable body of her work predates the first purely abstract compositions by Kandinsky, Malevich and Mondrian."

Identify an image by Hilma af Kling that you would like to use as a starting point. (We have placed a copy of her _Catalogue RaisonnÃ©_ in the classroom for you to browse. You can also find many of her images online.) Your goal will be to write a procedure that can generate a variety of variants of the image. In part, your goal is to be able to make individualized versions of the image. In part, your goal is to be able to better understand the underlying design ideas in the image.

Write a procedure, `(image-series n width height)`, that takes three non-negative integers as input and generates a `width`-by-`height` image that is similar to but different from your source image. Different values of `n` should give observably different images. The same `n`/`width`/`height` triplet should always give the same image; do not use randomness. You should support values of `n` between 0 and 999, inclusive. (You may also support other values of `n`.) You should support aspect ratios between 1:2 and 2:1.

You should find ways to use the following in your project.

* At least two of the ways we have of thinking about images: shapes, manipulating bitmaps by position, and manipulating bitmaps by using surrounding pixels.
* At least two kinds of recursion.

Additional requirements
-----------------------

### Design plans

Rather than just building whatever comes to mind, you should begin by coming up with a "design document" in which you sketch the goals of your project. Your document will have two parts: A textual description of what you are trying to achieve and how you anticipate doing so as well as a hand-drawn sketch (or sketches) of the original image and the ways in which you will vary that image.

### Presentation

Your group will give a 5-minute presentation to the class on your project on Wednesday, 8 May 2024. In your presentation, you should plan to discuss the original image, your design plans, show some images you geneated, and highlight one or more pieces of code you are most proud of. You should also be prepared to answer questions.

You must submit the slide deck for your presentation (PDF or Powerpoint) along with your project file.

### Time log

This project is scheduled for slightly more than a week of class. We ask you to spend about four hours of out-of-class time plus about two and a half hours of in-class time per team member, which includes planning, writing, development, and presentation preparation. No one should spend less than six hours. No one should spend more than ten hours. Please keep track of your time as you go in a time log that includes start time, stop time, elapsed time, and activity . Here's an example.

### Learning summary

Each group member should individually reflect on what they learned in the project.  You might consider what you learned about the work you are studying, programming, teamwork, yourself, etc.  You will enter this reflection in the MP9 post assessment.

What to submit
--------------

**Your code**, saved as `image-series.rkt`. The file should include your _time log_, your _design discussion_, and _any notes you have on "outstanding code"_.

**The original image(s)** that you are using as an inspiration.

**Your sketch or sketches** as you reflect on the original image and how you will generalize it.

**Your presentation** as a PDF or PowerPoint document. Please pick a team name and name it `Team.pdf` or `Team.pptx`, as appropriate.

**Four images (at least 600x500, no more than 3000x2000)**. Please name them `Team01.png`, `Team02.png`, `Team03.png`, and `Team04.png`, substituting the name of your team.

**Learning summary** (submitted separately and individually). In two or three paragraphs, summarize what you learned from doing this project.  You will enter this on the post-assessment.

Although "A procedure is worth 1,000 pictures" has long been a part of the image-making versions of CSC-151, the use of the project as an analysis tool was inspired by the works of James Clayson in his explorations of "Radical Bricolage".
