As you may know, a "word cloud" (also ["tag cloud"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_cloud)) is a visual representation of the most common words in a text (usually ignoring "common words", such as "a", "an", and "the").  The words are grouped in an approximately oval shape, with the dize of a word representing the approximate frequency in which the word appears in the text.

Some analysts promote word clouds because they provide a visually stimulating way to get an overview of the topics in a text.  Others note that word clouds may promote inappropriate conclusions, since we tend to assume nearby words are related, but most word-cloud algorithms do not use proximity in the text to compute proximity in the image.

Your assignment is to write a procedure, `(word-cloud filename)`, that builds a word cloud for the given file.  That is, it takes a filename (a string) as input, reads all the words from the file and computes their frequences (hint: hash tables), generates an appropriate-sized word image for each, and puts them together into a single image.

I strongly recommend that you decompose the problem into smaller pieces.

You can earn an M if you use a straightforward algorithm to put them together into a single image, such as stacking the words on top of each other.  (No, that's not much of a cloud.)  To earn an E, you will need to develop a more sophisticated algorithm.

Save your code in the file `word-cloud.rkt`.  Also include a file, `sample.png`, that shows a particularly successful cloud you generated.

Grading rubric
--------------

_This rubric is in draft form._

### Redo or above

Submissions that lack any of these characteristics will get an I.

```
[ ] Passes all of the one-star autograder tests.
[ ] Includes the specified file, `word-cloud.rkt`.
[ ] Includes an appropriate header on the file that indicates the
    course, author, etc.
[ ] Acknowledges appropriately.
[ ] Code runs in DrRacket.
[ ] The procedure `word-cloud` takes a filename as input and generates
    an image.
[ ] Includes the file `sample.png`.
```

### Meets expectations or above

Submissions that lack any of these characteristics but have all of the
prior characteristics will get an R.

```
[ ] Passes all of the two-star autograder tests.
[ ] Code is well-formatted with appropriate names and indentation.
[ ] Code has been reformatted with Ctrl-I before submitting.
[ ] Code generally follows style guidelines.
[ ] All procedures are documented in the correct form.
[ ] `word-cloud` has been appropriatelly decomposed into at least three 
    subprocedures.
[ ] Explains how `sample.png` was generated.
```

### Exemplary / Exceeds expectations

Submissions that lack any of these characteristics but have all of the
prior characteristics will get an M.

```
[ ] Passes all of the three-star autograder tests.
[ ] Style is impeccable (or nearly so).
[ ] Avoids repeated work.  In particular, avoids identical recursive calls.
[ ] Uses a non-trivial algorithm to build the cloud _and_ explains how
    the algorithm works.
[ ] Removes the most common words in English (e.g., "The", "A").
[ ] Uses color or typeface to indicate some additional characteristic
    of the word.
