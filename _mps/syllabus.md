As you might have been able to tell from the first day of class,
I have a wide variety of opinions about learning and teaching in CS
which are reflected in how I run the class.  You can (and should)
learn more about these perspectives from the course web.  In this
portion of the assignment, you will review the course web and answer
some basic questions.

First, read the following items.

* [The course syllabus]({{ site.url }}/syllabus/);
* [The course schedule]({{ site.url }}/schedule/);
* [My notes on teaching and learning]({{site.url}}/handouts/teaching);
* [My additional notes on grading]({{site.url}}/handouts/grading);
* [Some additional notes on learning assessments]({{site.url}}/las/);
* [My notes on taking notes]({{site.url}}/handouts/taking-notes);
* [My notes on academic honesty]({{site.url}}/handouts/academic-honesty);
* [The Computer Science Department's policy on academic honesty](https://www.cs.
grinnell.edu/academic-honesty-policy);
* [My notes on accommodations and adjustments]({{site.url}}/handouts/accommodati
ons);
* [My answers to any questions students have already asked about the
  course]({{site.url}}/handouts/faq)
  (That page will change over the next few days as I start receiving and
  answering questions for students.  You need not keep returning to it,
  although you may find it useful to do so.); 
* [Instructions for using Gradescope]({{ site.url }}/handouts/gradescope); and
* [Instructions for using Teams]({{ site.url }}/handouts/teams).

Log in to Gradescope and navigate to this class.

Finally, look for the the "Course details" assignment, select it, and answer the questions there.
