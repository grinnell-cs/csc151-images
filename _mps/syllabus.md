As you might have been able to tell from the first day of class,
I have a wide variety of opinions about learning and teaching in CS
which are reflected in how I run the class.  You can (and should)
learn more about these perspectives from the course web.  In this
portion of the assignment, you will review the course web and answer
some basic questions.

First, read the following items.

* [The course syllabus]({% link pages/syllabus.md %});
* [The course schedule]({% link pages/schedule.html %});
* [My additional notes on grading]({% link _handouts/grading.md %});
* [Some additional notes on learning assessments]({% link pages/las.md %});
* [My notes on taking notes]({% link _handouts/taking-notes.md %});
* [The Computer Science Department's policy on academic honesty](https://www.cs.
grinnell.edu/academic-honesty-policy);
* [Some answers to any questions students have already asked about the
  course]({% link _handouts/faq.md %})
  (That page will change over the next few days as I start receiving and
  answering questions for students.  You need not keep returning to it,
  although you may find it useful to do so.); 
* [Instructions for using Gradescope]({% link _handouts/gradescope.md %}); and
* [Instructions for using Teams]({% link _handouts/teams.md %}).
* [Some tips for working more productively]({% link _handouts/working-tips.md %})

Next, log in to Gradescope and navigate to this class. You can find a link to Gradescope at the top of each course page.

Finally, look for the the "Course details" assignment, select it, and answer the questions there.
