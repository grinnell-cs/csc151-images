# csc151-images

One of the many versions of Grinnell College's course CSC-151, _Functional Problem Solving_.

The special characteristics of this version include the following.

* A focus on image making as the problem domain.
* Uses the Scamper dialect of Scheme (as of 2023 Fall).
* Includes SamR's too-detailed course policies.

Most of the other versions of the course can be found on GitHub in the Grinnell CS organization, <https://github.com/orgs/grinnell-cs/>.
