; | Exercise 1: Modifying vectors |
; +-------------------------------+

#|
Suppose we are considering two names for the same vector and want to
try to change the first element. Consider the following code. (That is,
*read it, don't enter it*.)

    > (define chinchilla (vector "a" "b" "c" "d"))

    > (vector-set! chinchilla 0 "Z")

a. What do you expect the output of the following commands to be? (That
is, think about the answers and type the results; don't type the commands
in the Interactions pane.)

    > (vector-ref chinchilla 0)
    _____
    > (vector-ref dingo 0)
    _____
    > (vector-ref emu 0)

; +-------------------------------+----------------------------------
; | Exercise 2: Vector efficiency |
; +-------------------------------+

#|
We've claimed that vectors are much faster than lists.  Let's
conduct an experiment to see how much of a difference we see.

Here's a quick experiment that might give us a sense as to how
well `list-ref` works on a long list.

    (define size 10000)
    (define rounds 50000)
    (define list-of-values (range size))
    (define list-of-probes (random-nums rounds size))
    (define list-result
      (time (map (cut (list-ref list-of-values <>)) list-of-probes)))

Note that `time` reports on how long something takes.

|#

#|
a. Explain what it happening in this experiment.

<TODO: ENTER EXPLANATION>
|#

#|
b. Find values for `size` and `rounds` that make the computation
of `list-result` take around half a second (500 milliseconds; anywhere
between 300 milliseconds and 800 milliseconds should be fine). 

<TODO: ENTER NUMBERS AND RESULT TIME>
|#

#|
c. What do you expect to happen to the time for the computation of
`list-result` if we double the number of rounds (`rounds`)?  What
if we triple it?  

Check your answer experimentally and update as appropriate.  Make
sure to start with the values from b.

<TODO: ENTER YOUR EXPERIMENTS HERE, WITH NOTES AS TO SIZE>

<TODO: ENTER YOUR FINAL ANSWER HERE>
|#

#|
d. What do you expect to happen to the time for the computation if
we double the list size (`size`)?  What if we triple it?

Check your answer experimentally and update as appropriate.  Make
sure to start with the values from b.

Check your answer experimentally and update as appropriate.

<TODO: ENTER YOUR EXPERIMENTS HERE, WITH NOTES AS TO SIZE>

<TODO: ENTER YOUR FINAL ANSWER HERE>
|#

#|
e. Here's a followup experiment for vectors.

    (define vector-of-values (list->vector list-of-values))
    (define vector-result 
      (time (map (cut (vector-ref vector-of-values <>)) list-of-values)))

Will `vector-result` be the same as `list-result`?  Why or why not?

<ENTER YOUR ANSWER HERE>
|#

#|
f. Check your answer experimentally

    (equal? list-result vector-result)
|#

#|
g. Without changing `size`, find a value of `rounds` that makes
the computation of `vector-result` take about 50 milliseconds 
(anywhere between 30 and 800 should be fine).  

**Make sure that you do not recompute list-result**.  

    (define size 10000)
    (define rounds 2000000)
    (define list-of-values (range size))
    (define vector-of-values (list->vector list-of-values))
    (define vector-result 
      (time (map (section vector-ref vector-of-values <>) list-of-probes)))
|#

#|
h. What do you expect to happen to the time for the computation of
`vector-result` if we double the number of rounds (`rounds`)?  What
if we triple it?

Check your answer experimentally and update as appropriate.

<TODO: ENTER YOUR EXPERIMENTS HERE, WITH NOTES AS TO SIZE>

<TODO: ENTER YOUR FINAL ANSWER HERE>

#|
i. What do you expect to happen to the time for the computation if
we double the vector size (given by `size`)?  What if we triple
it?

Check your answer experimentally and update as appropriate.

; | Exercise 3: Vector-based palettes |
; +-----------------------------------+

#|
It is possible to represent a collection of colors (a "palette")
as a vector. Why would we do so? Well, once weâ€™ve chosen a palette,
we can represent an image as a collection of indices into that
palette. Such a representation is typically much more compact than
representing each color with the full RGB triplet.

For example, here is a palette that represents the colors in the
rainbow.
|#

; rainbow-palette : (vector-of rgb?)
(define rainbow-palette
  (list->vector
   (map color-name->rgb
        (list "red" "orange" "yellow" "green" "blue" "indigo" "violet"))))

#|
Write a procedure, `(palette? val)`, that determines if `val` is
a palette (a nonempty vector of RGB colors).
|#

;;; (palette? val) -> boolean?
;;;   val : any?
;;; Determine if `val` is a nonempty vector of RGB colors.
(define palette?
  (lambda (val)
    ???))

#| B |#

; +---------------------------------------------+--------------------
; | Exercise 4: Darkening vector-based palettes |
; +---------------------------------------------+

#|
Write a procedure, (palette-darker! palette), that, given a vector
of integer-encoded RGB colors, makes each color in the palette
slightly darker (i.e., using color-darker).

Note that you will not build a new vector. Rather, you will replace
each color in the existing vector by the darker version. You may
use the recursion pattern(s) from the reading and number-vector-scale!
as a starting point. If you do, be sure to cite your sources
appropriately.
|#

(define palette-darker!
  (lambda (palette)
    ???))

#| A |#

; +---------------------------------+--------------------------------
; | Exercise 5: The brightest color |
; +---------------------------------+

#|
Write a procedure, `(palette-brightest palette)`, that takes one argument,
a vector of colors, and returns the brightest color in that vector.
You can assume that every position in the vector contains a color.

You will likely need the following definitions of `color-brightness`
and `color-brighter-of-two`.
|#

;;; (color-brightness color) -> integer?
;;;   color : rgb?
;;; Compute the brightness of a color on a 0 .. 100 range.
(define color-brightness
  (lambda (color)
    (round (* 100 (/ (+ (* 30/100 (rgb-red color))
                        (* 59/100 (rgb-green color))
                        (* 11/100 (rgb-blue color)))
                      255)))))

;;; (color-brighter-of-two color1 color2) -> color?
;;;    color1 : rgb?
;;;    color2 : rgb?
;;; Find the brighter of two colors.
(define color-brighter-of-two
  (lambda (color1 color2)
    (if (>= (color-brightness color1) (color-brightness color2))
        color1
        color2)))

;;; (palette-brightest palette) -> rgb?
;;;   palette : (all-of (vector-of rgb?) nonempty?)
;;; Find the brightest color in `palette`. If multiple colors have
;;; the same brightness (and it's the largest brightness), can return
;;; any of them.
(define palette-brightest
  (lambda (palette)
    ???))

#| B |#

; +-------------------------------+----------------------------------
; | Exercise 6: Testing your code |
; +-------------------------------+

#|
Write five or more tests for `palette-brightest`, including at
least two edge cases.
|#

; "Normal" cases

; | Submit your work |
; +------------------+

#|
Yup, it's that time.  You should know the drill.
|#

; +---------------------------+--------------------------------------
; | For those with extra time |
; +---------------------------+

#|
If you find that you have extra time, you might try one or more 
of the following exercises.
|#

; +---------------------------+--------------------------------------
; | Extra 1: Tallying letters |
; +---------------------------+
#|
a. Fill in the missing parts of the documentation for the following
procedure.
|#

;;; (lowercase->number letter) -> ___
;;;   letter : char? (#\a through #\z)
;;; ____
(define lowercase->number
  (let ([a-num (char->integer #\a)])
    (lambda (letter)
      (- (char->integer letter) a-num))))

#|
b. Using `lowercase->number` and `number-vector-increment-at!`, write
a procedure, `(record-letter! tallies letter)`, that takes as input a
vector of integers (representing tallies of the 26 letters) and a letter,
and updates the appropriate entry in the tallies.

    > (define tallies (make-vector 26 0))
    > tallies
    '#(0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0)
    > (record-letter! tallies #\c)
    > (record-letter! tallies #\z)
    > (record-letter! tallies #\c)
    > tallies
    '#(0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1)
|#

;;; (record-letter! tallies letter) -> void?
;;;   tallies : vectorof integer? (length 26)
;;;   letter : char? (#\a through #\z)
;;; Add to the tally for the given letter.
(define record-letter!
  (lambda (tallies letter)
    ???))

#|
c. Finish the following definition of `tally-letters-in-string`, which
takes as input a string and returns a vector that tallies the letters
of the string.

Note that `(when TEST EXP1 EXP2 ...)` first evaluates the test.  If
the test holds, it then evaluates the expressions in sequence,
returning the value of the last one.  It is essentially the same
as `(cond [TEST EXP1 EXP2 ...])`.
|#

;;; (tally-letters-in-string str) -> vectorof integer?
;;;   str : string?
;;; Count how many time each lowercase letter appears in str.
(define tally-letters-in-string
  (lambda (str)
    (let ([tallies (make-vector 26 0)])
      (tally-letters-in-string/helper str 
                                      tallies
                                      (- (string-length str) 1))
      tallies)))

;;; (tally-letters-in-string/helper str tallies pos) -> (void)
;;;   str : string?
;;;   tallies : vectorof integer? (length 26)
;;;   pos : non-negative integer?
;;; Tallies the letters in str from 0 to pos (inclusive)
(define tally-letters-in-string/helper
  (lambda (str tallies pos)
    (when (>= pos 0)
      (let ([ch (string-ref str pos)])
        (when (char<=? #\a ch #\z)
          ???))
      ???)))

; +--------------------------------------+---------------------------
; | Extra 2: Tallying letters, revisited |
; +--------------------------------------+

#|
Write a new version of `tally-letters-in-string` that counts
up from 0 to the string length, rather than down from the length
to 0.
