; | Exercise 0: Preparation |
; +-------------------------+

#|
a. Have your traditional start-of-lab discussion.
|#

#|
b. Save this as `tree-recursion.rkt`
|#

#|
c. In a separate window, open the source code for the list-based
tree library, available at

https://github.com/grinnell-cs/csc151/blob/main/binary-trees-from-lists.rkt
|#

#|
d. In a separate window, open the source code for the additional
tree utilities, available at

|#

#| B |#

; +-------------------------------------------------+----------------
; | Exercise 1: Finding the largest value in a tree |
; +-------------------------------------------------+

#|
You may recall that we wrote most, but not all, of a procedure that
finds the largest value in a tree of real numbers.
|#

;;; (binary-tree-largest tree) -> real?
;;;   tree : binary-tree-of real? (nonempty)
;;; Finds the largest value in the tree.
(define binary-tree-largest/bad
  (lambda (tree)
    (if (leaf? tree)
        (bt/t tree)
        (max (bt/t tree)
             (binary-tree-largest/bad (bt/l tree))
             (binary-tree-largest/bad (bt/r tree))))))

#|
As we observed in the reading, we encouter a problem when
one, but not both, of a node's children are empty trees.

Rewrite `binary-tree-largest` to address that issue.

(define binary-tree-largest
  (lambda (tree)

; | Exercise 3: Searching vectors |
; +-------------------------------+

#|
The reading contains two procedures for searching trees.  Before we
start searching trees, let's remind ourselves of how we might search
vectors.

Consider the following procedure.
|#

;;; (vector-find vec str) -> string? (or boolean?)
;;;   vec : vectorof string?
;;;   str : string?
;;; Finds a word equal to string in vec, ignoring case.
;;; Returns false if it can't find it.
(define vector-find
  (lambda (vec str)
    (letrec ([helper 
              (lambda (pos)
                (if (< pos 0)
                    #f
                    (let ([current (vector-ref vec pos)])
                      ; (displayln current)
                      (if (string-ci=? str current)
                          current
                          (helper (- pos 1))))))])
      (helper (- (vector-length vec) 1)))))

#|
a. Explain, in your own words, how this procedure works.

<TODO: Enter your explanation>
|#

#|
Consider the following vector.
|#

(define names (vector "Aardvark" "Chinchilla" "Dingo" "Emu" "Fennec Fox"
                      "Gnu" "Hippo" "Iguana" "Jackalope" "Llama" "Skink"))

#|
b. What names do you expect the `vector-find` to look at when searching
for `"Koala"`?

<TODO: Enter your answer here.>

Check your answer experimentally (e.g., by printing out the current
value after the `let` with `(displayln current)`).

|#

#|
c. If the vector contains 1000 elements, how many values do you
expect to look at when searching for an element not in the vector?

<TODO: Enter your answer here.>
|#

; +-----------------------------+------------------------------------

#|
a. The reading and lab provide two different procedures for searching
trees.  What are they?  How are they similar?  How are they different?

<TODO: Enter your answer here.>

#|
b. The following code converts the vector from the prior exercise
to a tree.  Sketch the tree here using whatever technique you'd
like (e.g., ASCII art, indented racket code, etc.).

|#

; A tree of names
(define ton (vector->tree names))

#|
c. What names do you expect `(binary-tree-contains? ton "Koala")` to look at?

<TODO: Enter your answer here>

Check your answer experimentally (e.g., by uncommenting the `(displayln root)`
after the `let` that defines `root` in `binary-tree-contains?`).

<TODO: Enter your answer here> (you can copy and paste)
|#

#|
d. What names do you expect the `(binary-tree-contains? ton "Llama")` to 
look at?

<TODO: Enter your answer here>

|#

#|
e. If the vector from which we built the tree contained 1000 elements,
how many values do you expect `binary-tree-contains?` to look at
when searching for an element not in the tree?

<TODO: Enter your answer here>

Check your answer experimentally with 
`(binary-tree-contains? (random-bst 1000) "Koala")`.

|#

; +-------------------------------------------+----------------------
; | Exercise 5: Searching binary search trees |

#|
a. What names do you expect the `bst-find` to look at in a call to
`(bst-find? ton "Llama")`?

Check your answer experimentally (e.g., by uncommenting the 
`(displayln root)` after the `let` that defines `root` in `bst-find`
and then running the find again).

; | Extra 2: Flattening trees |
; +---------------------------+

#|
a. Write a function `(flatten-tree t)` which takes a tree `t` as
input and outputs a list containing all of the elements of `t`.

(*Hint*: recall that `(append l1 l2)` takes two lists `l1` and `l2`
         and returns a list that is the result of appending `l2` onto
         the end of `l1`.)
|#

;;; (flatten-tree t) -> list?
;;;   t : binary-tree?
;;; Convert t to a list.  Each element in t appears once in the list.
(define flatten-tree
  (lambda (t)
    (if (empty-tree? t)
        *BASE-CASE*
        (*COMBINE* (*PROCESS* (bt/t t))
                   (flatten-tree (bt/l t))
                   (flatten-tree (bt/r t))))))

#|
b. What do you expect to get from `(flatten-tree digits-tree)`

<TODO: Enter your answer>

Check your answer experimentally.

    > (flatten-tree digits-tree)
    ?
|#

#|
c. Note that in the recursive case of `flatten-tree`, there are three
"lists" that you are combining:

*  The current element (as a list of one).
*  A list containing the values from the left subtree.
*  A list containing the values from the right subtree.

In the reading, we talked about changing the order of recursive
calls to the left- and right-subtrees for `tree-sum`. Does the order
matter here?

<TODO: Enter your answer here>
|#

#|
d.  Write *two additional variants* of `flatten-tree` that produce
*different* ordering of the elements with the restriction that the
elements in the left subtree have to appear before the elements in
the right subtree.  (Basically, you'll just need to switch where
you handle the root/top relative to the subtrees.)
|#

; IMPORTANT: When implementing these functions, make sure your recursive
;            calls are made to those functions. In other words, don't
;            recursively call `flatten-tree` from flatten-tree-alt-1!

(define flatten-tree-alt-1
  ???)

(define flatten-tree-alt-2
  ???)

#|
c. When you are done, you should have three implementations of
`flatten-tree` that produce different orderings of the input list. The
canonical name for these traversals are *pre-order*, *in-order*, and
*post-order* traversals. Use your intuition about the prefixes "pre"
(before), "in" (between), and "post" (after) to assign your
implementation the names `flatten-pre`, `flatten-in`, and
`flatten-post`, respectively. You can fill in the definitions below by
simply defining these identifiers to be aliases of flatten-tree and
its alternative versions.
|#

; NOTE: which of these functions should we assign flatten-alt,
;       flatten-tree-alt-1 and flatten-tree-alt-2?

(define flatten-preorder
  ???)

(define flatten-inorder
  ???)

(define flatten-postorder
  ???)

#|
e. In the space below, describe the differences between the three
kinds of traversals in terms of the order in which they visit elements
in the tree.

<TODO: write your explanation here>
