In this lab you will be working with your partner to discover
common ways we manipulate the basic primitive types of Racket.
Please refer to the lab write-up as well as the reference page
on the course website for more information about the various
functions we introduce in this lab.

For this lab, the A side will begin driving and B side will navigate.
The A side of this lab consists of exploration of the primitive
numeric types.

Once you are done with the A side, switch to the B side problems
that have your team explore the textual primitive types.  Here,
B side should drive and A side should nevigate.  When you are done,
combine both your files, rename them to basic-types.rkt, and upload
the file to Gradescope.

As a reminder, please make sure to work synchronously on this lab.
That is, you should not take your individual parts and work on them
in isolation.  The lab is designed for you to work together and
collaborate on a solution!  In particular, the navigator should be
focused on the problem the driver is working on and doing other
stuff.

1. Make sure to introduce yourself to your partner.

2. Make sure to save this file as basic-types.rkt.

3. Optional: Review the Q&A.

; +----------------------------------------+-------------------------
; | Exercise 1: Simple numeric computation |
; +----------------------------------------+

#| Please don't spend more than five minutes on this exercise. |#

#|
a. Determine the type DrRacket gives for the square root of
two, computed by (sqrt 2).  Is it exact or inexact?  Real?
Rational?  An Integer?

<TODO: fill in the type of (sqrt 2) here>

|#

#|
b. As we discussed last class, one way to check our answer
is to "undo" the square root function via multiplication.
We can even observe that the difference of this result and the
expected value 2 evaluates to 0.

Write a pair of expressions that calculates the square of
(sqrt 2) via multiplication and then takes the difference of that
result from the expected value.  We call this latter value
the error of computation.
|#

(define square-root-of-two-squared ???)

;(define difference-between-that-number-and-two 
; (- square-root-of-two-squared 2))

#|
c. You may find the values that these two values evaluate to a bit
surprising!  In the space below, write a few sentences describing
what you discovered and why you believe that to be the case.

<TODO: fill in the requested information here>
|#

#|
d. In the space below, describe whether you expect your answer
to be the same if you instead used (sqrt 4) rather than (sqrt 2).
Explain your reasoning and check your work experimentally with
the interactions panel of DrRacket.

<TODO: Fill in some notes here.>
|#

; +------------------------+-----------------------------------------
; | Exercise 2: Remainders |
; +------------------------+

#|
As the reading suggests, the remainder procedure computes the amount
"left over" after you divide one number by another.  The reading
suggests that remainder provides an interesting alternative to using
max and min to limit (but not cap) the values of functions.

a. `(remainder x y)` gives you the amount "left over" when you 
divide x by y.  For example (remainder 13 3) should give you 1,
because 13 divided by 3 is 4 with 1 left over.

Predict the values of each expressions in the space provided
below.  **Do not use the interpreter yet!**

> (remainder 8 3)
<TODO: fill in the resulting value here>
> (remainder 3 8)
<TODO: fill in the resulting value here>
> (remainder 8 8)
<TODO: fill in the resulting value here>
> (remainder 9 8)
<TODO: fill in the resulting value here>
> (remainder 16 8)
<TODO: fill in the resulting value here>
> (remainder 827 8)
<TODO: fill in the resulting value here>
> (remainder 0 8)

<TODO: fill in the resulting value here>
> (remainder -8 3)
<TODO: fill in the resulting value here>
> (remainder -3 8)
<TODO: fill in the resulting value here>
|#

#|
b. Check your answers experimentally with DrRacket, one at a time.
If you any of your answers disagree, try to come up with an explanation
why.  If you cannot come up with one, feel free to hail down a
member of the course staff for help (with @staff, if you are online).

; | Exercise 3: From reals to integers |
; +------------------------------------+

#|
As the reading on numbers suggests, Racket provides four
functions that convert real numbers to nearby integers: floor,
ceiling, round, and truncate.  The reading also claims there are
differences between all four.

To the best of your ability, figure out what each does, and what
distinguishes it from the other three.  In your test, you should
try both positive and negative numbers, numbers close to integers,
and numbers far from integers.  (Numbers whose fractional part is
0.5 are about as far from an integer as any real number can be.)

Write your descriptions of each function in the spaces below:

(floor r): <TODO: insert your description here>
(ceiling r): <TODO: insert your description here>
(truncate r): <TODO: insert your description here>
(round r): <TODO: insert your description here>

When you are done, feel free to read the notes on this problem
which can be found in the lab page.

; +---------------------------+-------------------------------------
; | Exercise 4: Large numbers |
; +---------------------------+

#|
Many programming languages have limits on the size of the numbers they
represent. In some cases, if the number is large enough, they
approximate it. In other cases, if the number is large enough, the
calculations you do with the error are erroneous. (Youâ€™ll learn why in
a subsequent course.) And in still others, the language treats large
enough values as the special value "infinity".
|#

#|
a. See what happens if you try to have DrRacket compute with some very
large exact integers. You may find the expt function helpful. Then see
what happens if you try convert those integers to inexact values. Here
are two examples to start with, but you should try more.

> (define x (expt 2 100))
> (define ex (exact->inexact x))

<TODO: Fill in your observations here>
|#

#|
b. See what happens if you try to have DrRacket compute with some very
small exact rational numbers (say, 1 divided by one of those large
numbers). Then see what happens if you convert those rational numbers
to inexact values. Describe what you observe in your file in a few
sentences below.

<TODO: fill in your observations here>
|#

#|
When you are done, feel free to read the notes on this problem which
can be found in the accompanying lab.
|#

; +--------------------------+---------------------------------------
; | Exercise 5: Digit tricks |
; +--------------------------+

#|
For these programming problems over numbers, think carefully about
how you might use integer division and rounding to accomplish the
desired behavior.
|#

#|
a. Write a procedure, (ones-digit-of n), that takes an integer n as
input and returns the value of the ones digit (i.e., the rightmost
digit) in that number.  For example:

> (ones-digit-of 21904)
4
> (ones-digit-of 0)
0
|#

(define ones-digit-of
  (lambda (n)
    ???))

#|
b. Write a procedure (truncate-ones-from n) that takes an integer n
and returns n, but with the digit in the ones position removed.  If
the number has only one digit, then 0 is returned.  For example:

> (truncate-ones-from 4210)
421
> (truncate-ones-from 3)
0
|#

(define truncate-ones-from
  (lambda (n)
    ???))

#|
c. Check your functions on negative numbers.  Do they work as expected?
If not, how might you fix that issue?

> (ones-digit-of -42)
2 ; -2 would also be okay
> (truncate-ones-from -42)
-4

<TODO: Insert notes on how you might fix the issue, if you have it.>

Switch driver and navigator.  (B will now drive, A will now navigate.)

; +--------------------------+---------------------------------------
; | Exercise 6: Creating @'s |
; +--------------------------+

#|
Develop three ways of constructing the string "@@@": one using a call
to make-string, one a call to string, and one a call to list->string.
|#

(define making-@s-with-make-string ???)

(define making-@s-with-string ???)

(define making-@s-with-list->string ???)

; +-----------------------------+------------------------------------
; | Exercise 7: Textual corners |
; +-----------------------------+

#|
Each of the following expressions evaluates to a string.  For each
expression write (a) its length of its resulting string value and
(b) a sentence description of the resulting string.
|#

#|
Length of corner-1: 
Description of corner-1: 
|#
(define corner-1 "")

#|
Length of corner-2: 
Description of corner-2: 
|#
(define corner-2 "hello world!")


#|
Length of corner-3: 
Description of corner-3: 
|#
(define corner-3 "\"hello world!\"")

#|
Length of corner-4: 
Description of corner-4: 
|#
(define corner-4 (string #\space))

#|
Length of corner-5: 
Description of corner-5: 
|#
(define corner-5 (string))

#|
Enter any notes on what you've learned from this exercise.

|#

; +------------------------+-----------------------------------------
; | Exercise 8: Substrings |
; +------------------------+

#|
Consider the string "Department". Using the substring procedure, we
can extract a wide variety of words from this one string. Write a
Racket expression to extract each of the requested words below. You
may use substring multiple times in combination with string-append,
but please do not use string constants (e.g. "apart"), characters, or
any other procedures.

a. Write an expression to extract the string "Depart" from "Department".
b. Write an expression to extract the string "part" from "Department".
c. Write an expression to extract the string "ment" from "Department".
d. Write an expression to extract the string "a" from "Department".
e. Write an expression to extract the empty string from "Department".
f. Write an expression to extract the string "Dent" from
   "Department". Note that you may need to use two calls to substring
   along with a call to string-append.
g. Write an expression to extract the string "apartment" from
   "Department". Once again, you may need multiple calls.

Use the interactions pane to check that each of your defined
expressions produces the desired value.
|#

(define substring-ex-a "TODO!")

(define substring-ex-b "TODO!")

(define substring-ex-c "TODO!")

(define substring-ex-d "TODO!")

(define substring-ex-e "TODO!")

(define substring-ex-f "TODO!")

(define substring-ex-g "TODO!")

; +---------------------------------+--------------------------------
; | Exercise 9: Referencing lengths |
; +---------------------------------+

#|
Here are two opposing views about the relationship between
string-length and string-ref:

a. "No matter what string str is, provided that it is not the empty
   string, (string-ref str (string-length str)) will return the last
   character in the string."
b. "No matter what string str is,
   (string-ref str (string-length str)) is an error."

Which, if either, of these views is correct? Why? Experiment with code
in the interactions pane, substituting concrete strings for str (e.g.,
"hello world!"), to arrive at an answer. Answer this in a sentence or
two in the space below.

; | Exercise 10: Collating your sequences |
; +---------------------------------------+

#|
In the reading, we discussed the fact that Racket assigns each of its
characters a unique integer.  These numbers are called a collating
sequence.  In this exercise, we'll explore these sequences in more
detail.
|#

#|
a. Compare notes with your partner about your answers to Check 2:
Collating sequences from the reading.  Use this acquired knowledge
to answer the following question:

What are the collating sequence numbers for the uppercase English
letters (A--Z)?  Write your answer in the space below:

<TODO: write your description here>

(Hint: the description should be shorter than listing 26 letter-number
pairs!)
|#

#|
b. Use your answer from part (a) to describe in a few sentences a
method for determining if a character is an upper-case English letter
by using collating sequences and subtraction.

<TODO: describe your method here>
|#

#|
c. Describe how you would extend your answer to part (b) to also
include lower-case English letters.  Can you just use the numbers
corresponding to 'A' (the beginning of the uppercase letter sequence)
and 'z' (the end of the lowercase letter sequence) or do we need to do
something more complicated?

<TODO: describe your updated method here
|#

#|
d. Finally, let's think a little bit more broadly!  What about other
languages?  For example, below are lowercase and uppercase alpha and
omega, the beginning and end of the Greek alphabet:

Î‘ (uppercase alpha---note: *not* A!)
Î± (lowercase alpha)
Î© (uppercase omega)
Ï‰ (lowercase omega)

Describe in a few sentences how you would incorporate other languages
into your technique.  If you have the capability, try out letters in
other languages to see if your technique still works!

; +---------------------------+--------------------------------------
; | For those with extra time |
; +---------------------------+

#|
If you find that you finish all of these problems early, try one
or more of the following problems.  Note that some of these problems
require you to write functions which we will learn about in a day
or two.  For now feel free to try to write expressions for concrete
values, *e.g.*, strings, numbers, and lists that produce the effect
described, and come back once we learn about functions to generalize
the results with functions!

; | Extra 1: Exploring rational numbers |
; +-------------------------------------+

#|
DrRacket's implementation of Scheme permits you to treat any real
number as a rational number, which means we can get the numerator
and denominator of any real number.  Let's explore what numerator
and denominator that implementation uses for a variety of values.
|#

#|
a.  Determine the numerator and denominator of the rational
representation of the square root of 2.
  numerator: 
  denominator: 

b.  Determine the numerator and denominator of the rational
representation of 1.5.
  numerator: 
  denominator: 

c.  Determine the numerator and denominator of the rational
representation of 1.2.
  numerator: 
  denominator: 

d.  Determine the numerator and denominator of 6/5.
  numerator: 
  denominator: 

If you are puzzled by some of the later answers, you may want to read the
notes on the problem, which you can find in the lab instructions.

Note that we will not expect you to regularly figure out these
strange numerators and denominators.
|#

; +-----------------------------+------------------------------------
; | Extra 2: Rounding revisited |
; +-----------------------------+

#|
You may recall that we have a number of mechanisms for rounding real
numbers to integers. But what if we want to round not to an integer,
but to only two digits after the decimal point? Scheme does not include
a built-in operation for doing that kind of rounding. Nonetheless,
it is fairly straightforward.

Suppose we have a value, `val`. Write instructions that give val rounded
to the nearest hundredth. For example,

    > (define val 22.71256)
    > (your-instructions val)
    22.71
    > (define val 10.7561)
    > (your-instructions val)
    10.76

Hint: You know how to round at the decimal point.  Thik about ways
to shift the decimal point.

It's fine if your procedure does not work perfectly for all values.
