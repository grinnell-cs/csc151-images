_Explain best practices for solving problems in a collaborative setting._

Consider the following dialogue between driver and navigator.

Driver: I'm not quite sure what to do here.  What do you think?

Navigator: Really?  It's easy.  You just need a call to map.  Type
"map square list 1 2 3".

Driver: Ok.  Like this?

Navigator: No!  You need a paren before map.  And just type the
single quote for the list.  You spell it "sqr" not "square".

Navigator: Don't put another single quote at the end of the list!

Navigator: Let's start again.  Open parenthesis.  The word "map".  A space.
The word "ess queue are".  Another space.  A tick mark.  Another open
parenthesis.  The numeral 1.  A space.  The numeral 2.  A space.  The
numeral 3.  A close parenthesis.  Another close parenthesis.

Driver: What else do you think we should do?

Navigator: Press the return key.  Duh.

a. What went well in this conversation?

b. What went poorly?

c. How could the navigator have been a better partner?
