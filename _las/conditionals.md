# {{ page.title }}

Utilize boolean expressions and values in a program to produce conditional behavior._

As you know, we often associate words with students' standing in college.  At Smileyville College, Those who have completed fewer than four terms are "freshlings", those who have completed between four and seven terms (inclusive) are "wise fools", those who have completed between eight and eleven terms (inclusive) are "subordinates", and those who have completed at least twelve terms are "elders".

Write a procedure, `(status terms)`, that, given the number of terms a student has completed as input, produces a string that describes the student using the terms above.
