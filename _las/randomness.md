_Write programs that produce unpredictable output._

Grinnell has suggested that we make up "random ids" for the students in our classes that we can use in online platforms.

Write a procedure, `(random-id)`, that creates a string consisting of a random six-letter identifier of the form consonant-vowel-consonant-vowel-consonant-vowel, with all letters uppercase.

```
> (random-id)
"PALEQO"
> (random-id)
"ZEDUMI"
```
